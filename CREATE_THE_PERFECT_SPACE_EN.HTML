					We have all heard the saying ”everything in its place“, and it is almost a motto for any family that
					works in an organized way. However, when the house also becomes the work or study space, there
					should be a clear delimitation of the space in which these activities are carried out, in order to
					be able to carry out the tasks comfortably and without distractions.<br/>It is important to
					organize a room or a space at home that is comfortable to work or study in. It creates harmony with
					the rest of the space in the home, but at the same time, it is well differentiated.<br/>I can
					assure you that this harmony can be achieved if you spend a little time to select the space that you
					will use for this and if you make a correct selection of the furniture you will use. It is necessary
					to take some tips into account.<br/>Telecommuting or studying from home is definitely common now in
					days. It is a reality that is increasingly implanted in society.<br/>But since its arrival, there
					are many companies, workers, and students who have realized the many benefits that this way of
					providing a service or studying comfortably entails.<br/>Today I want to be a small guide in the
					process of creating the perfect space in your home where you can develop your skills and ideas if
					you are an entrepreneur and carry out your work or academic responsibilities.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Unquestionably, having a space to work or study at home has become a necessity in many homes today.
					The design of the office or place of study becomes an essential element for the organization of
					family life and for personal development.<br/><br/>For many of us the objective is to achieve a
					balance between both and to carry it out with maximum comfort, both the development of the
					professional activity and the coexistence with the rest of the family members.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The fact that you work or study from home should not be a reason for a large part of your home to
					become a large space for work or study activities. Therefore, it is very important to define the
					spaces, in order to separate the daily activities of the home, and the activities related to our
					professional development.<br/><br/>If you have enough space at home, the ideal would be to
					allocate a room exclusively to create your office or study. However, on many occasions this is not
					possible, since not all homes have enough space.<br/><br/>A living room with an office can work as
					an area of the home to work or study, without mixing with the rest of the household chores. In this
					case, since it is a small space, it will be necessary to consider incorporating only the elements
					that are really necessary, such as desks, chairs, and a file cabinet or small piece of furniture
					that allows you to have everything perfectly organized.

				<p class="mt-3">
					For your work or study to not become a real torture, it is very important to pay attention to the
					choice of the chair that will adorn that space and in which we will spend much of our time working
					and studying.<br/><br/>It is definitely the element that will serve as support throughout the work
					or academic day remotely. It is true, as a general rule, the sitting posture of the human body is
					unnatural. It is very common for back pain, neck pain, and even long-term injuries to be generated.
					So having an ergonomic and great quality chair is relevant to doing a good job and not diminishing
					the quality of life.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Keep in mind that the space you select to place your home office or to create a study area is where
					you are going to spend much of your time. It is highly recommended to think carefully about what the
					ideal space will be. You will need good lighting and if it is natural it would be much
					better.<br/><br/>In case the selected space does not have good natural lighting, you will have to
					place good artificial lighting. But the ideal would be a space where you can take advantage of
					natural light, which brings vitality, well-being, and enormous health benefits.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Houses are to be enjoyed and that means that on more than one occasion, order will not reign
					completely. However, in the work and study area, order is essential. If you are not lucky enough to
					have a room for this purpose, it is important to try not to have the room full of
					papers.<br/><br/>If it is a shared space, you should treat this corner as if it were an island,
					untouchable and always in perfect condition.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are many people who
					currently work at home and who must prepare their homes to be able to have an office that, in
					addition to being comfortable, is functional and aesthetic to be able to perform functions well.
					There are also other people who have work outside the home, but need a space in their homes to be
					able to do some work at home during hours outside the office.<br/><br/>Do you have or want to have
					a work area at home, but you have limited space in your home? If so, don't worry, because even if
					the space is small it doesn't mean that it can’t be functional, practical, cozy, and also make you
					feel good whenever you have to perform your function and make use of it.<br/><br/>I hope you can
					create your home office and enjoy it to the fullest. Once again, thanks for reading and I say
					goodbye until the next article.

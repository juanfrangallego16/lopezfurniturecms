				<p class="mt-3">
					Art Deco tried to emulate the drama and grandeur of the big movie productions. Color palettes in
					neutral tones were used that were perfectly combined with bright fabrics and very luxurious
					materials.<br/><br/>It is important to note that it is a style that integrates colors with
					geometric shapes and ornamental details. Some of the most used colors are white, black, red, green,
					pale blue, and silver. But the color that cannot be absent because it is very characteristic of this
					style is the color gold. Yes, it is true that sometimes it is a bit complex to use it without
					overloading the space.<br/><br/>Currently, many companies manufacture <a

					and accessories that make it relatively easy to have a home inspired by Art Deco decoration.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Some of the most used materials in this style of interior decor, are chrome, brass, aluminum, and
					stainless steel. These metals are very common in accessories such as <a

					<a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=vases">vases</a>, photo frames, or even in certain details of the
					furniture. The use of exotic woods is also important.<br/><br/>Velvet fabrics that convey glamor
					are joined with organic and round shapes in pieces of furniture such as <a

					style are glass, leather, and mirror. Oil paintings, <a

				<p class="mt-3">
					Paying attention to the decoration of floors and walls is a fairly simple way to integrate a style
					such as Art Deco in your home.<br/><br/>From using wallpaper with geometric shapes or painting the
					walls with the right colors, as well as floor coverings, are details that will give a very original
					touch to this style of decoration.

					Making the right selection of furniture and <a
						href="/miscellaneous/miscellaneous/home-accents?type=other-home-accents">decorative accessories</a> is very important,
					since the total success of the decoration of our home will depend on this.<br/><br/>At this point,
					I must mention that lamps play a leading role in the Art Deco style. The idea is that they have
					original designs and shapes some type of metal. Gold and silver colors are preferred for lamps in
					this style, and if they have blown glass shades it is much better.<br/><br/>The lamps will give
					your décor a beautiful look, as will the integration of mirrors. As for the furniture, my
					recommendation is that you opt for elegantly designed furniture that combines wood with leather
					upholstery or delicate fabrics such as velvet. But of course, it must match perfectly with the range
					of colors you use on the walls.<br/><br/>Décor made from wood, silver, bronze, and iron will help
					you define the Art Deco style in your home.

					I think that Art Deco also has some touches of classic and vintage style. If you want to integrate
					the Art Deco style into the decoration of your home, keep in mind that the furniture used for this
					style has defined lines and in terms of materials, we find everything from exotic woods to metals.
					Materials that are easy to combine with the environment and that maintain the aesthetic values of
					the Art Deco style.<br/><br/>If you like luxury, this style is for you. I encourage you to give
					your home the sophisticated aesthetics of the Art Deco style. I hope you enjoyed reading this
					article and are now inspired to make some changes around your home design. Thank you very much for

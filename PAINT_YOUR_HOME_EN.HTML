				<p class="section-header mt-3">1.Neutral Colors</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					These range from white, gray, black, beige, ivory to colors with very low saturation.<br/>Neutral
					colors are a symbol of sobriety and elegance. They do not influence other shades, and they are good
					to combine with almost any other color.<br/>If you also dare to add different textures in cushions,
					blankets, rugs, and other accessories, you will achieve cozy spaces.<br/>They are elegant, serene
					and this color palette is especially indicated in minimalist interiors and Nordic
					decorations.<br/><br/><strong>White:</strong> it is the brightest. It creates a feeling of
					spaciousness and freshness. It combines perfectly with other neutral colors or any intense color. It
					produces the feeling of purity and cleanliness.<br/><br/><strong>Gray:</strong> like any color,
					gray has infinite shades. These can be divided into soft, médium, and dark tones.<br/>The soft
					grays maintain the feeling of light and spaciousness in the spaces, they also create a more elegant
					and modern atmosphere.<br/>Medium grays can be combined with pastel colors, thus creating a sense
					of harmony in your home. To achieve this balance you can apply them to elements that complement your
					decoration.<br/>Dark grays are riskier and can absorb too much light, creating the feeling of tight
					spaces. With the right decoration, you can create a sober and elegant
					atmosphere.<br/><br/><strong>Black:</strong> it is used in the company of a soft gray or white
					tone. With the latter, a very attractive combination is achieved that never goes out of
					style.<br/>Black is very rare on the walls and is more used for furniture and upholstery, having
					gray, beige, or cream colors on the walls, generating an elegant and serene
					atmosphere.<br/><br/>Neutral colors are calm and elegant and generate those same sensations in the
					environment where they are being used.<br/>

				<p class="mt-3">
					The cold tones like blues, violets, and greens bring freshness, calm, and spaciousness to the home.
					Depending on the hue, cool colors can convey a sense of calm and professionalism as well.<br/>In
					fields such as <strong>decoration or architecture</strong>, they are used to create the feeling of
					more space, distance, and spaciousness.<br/><br/><strong>Green:</strong> in its different shades
					and finishes is an excellent option for the home. It can be applied in a bedroom, living room,
					dining room, bathroom, or kitchen. It goes very well with neutral, pastel, and gold colors. Green
					tones stimulate the feeling of harmony and peace.<br/><br/><strong>Blue:</strong> when we think of
					the color blue, the sky or the sea comes to mind. This color provides a feeling of calm and
					tranquility.<br/>Blue can also help us increase the feeling of space in a room. The light tones are
					perfect for bedrooms, work areas, and bathrooms. Dark tones are an excellent option to give
					sophistication in large spaces.<br/><br/><strong>Purple:</strong> it means elegance and power.
					But, on the other hand, it is capable of transmitting peace and tranquility. In soft tones, such as
					lavender, have a powerful sedative effect. Perfect for bedrooms.<br/>Darker shades create dramatic
					effects that are fantastic. You should use them in moderation or they can cause depressing
					effects.<br/><br/>Would you like to include a cool color in your home that is unexpected? Well,
					purple is a great option. It is the color of choice for an inventive atmosphere that also provides
					stability.<br/>Cold colors are better in spaces where concentration, calm, and rest are the
					protagonists.<br/>

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.Warm Colors</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Warm colors are yellows, reds, oranges, and all derived hues.<br/>In large rooms, they visually
					decrease the space. They are perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere in the dining
					area.<br/><br/><strong>Yellow:</strong> represents everything related to energy. But beware! It is
					not highly recommended for rooms because it will not give you a good rest.<br/>The yellow tones
					bring a lot of light to the space and attracts joy and happiness. That is why this color is ideal
					for the hall, the living room, or the kitchen.<br/><br/><strong>Orange:</strong> It enhances
					furniture and accessories, creating a feeling of warmth and well-being.<br/>We recommend that if
					you decide to use it, do so in moderation, as it can make a room seem smaller, claustrophobic, and
					stressful.<br/><br/><strong>Red:</strong> It is used for details and small areas such as a single
					wall, combining with the color of the rest of the walls. For minimalist decorations, this is the
					color most used to mix with neutral tones.<br/><br/>It also looks great in <strong>retro</strong>
					and <strong>vintage</strong> settings. It is interesting if you use it in some decor and fabrics.
					Although, if you are looking to sophisticate a space, you can choose to paint a wall red but
					compensate its strength with natural wood and white.<br/><br/>
					<strong>Pink:</strong> It is a pleasant and comforting color. It transmits very tender and positive
					sensations. It gives us calm and serenity. Note that it is very useful against
					stress.<br/><br/>Combining shades with intense pink can turn the rooms into warm environments.
					Ensures you a pleasant space to fall asleep.

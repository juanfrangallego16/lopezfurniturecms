				<p class="mt-3">
					There is no doubt that an excellent way to achieve more warmth is to combine gray with earth tones.
					Beige, mustard, camel, among others, are colors that blend perfectly with gray, regardless of
					whether they are in lighter or darker tones. Keep in mind, if we are attracted to this combination
					for our home, you can be sure that these colors will give a touch of warmth to your home.
					<br/><br/>
					Integrate them into your home decor in the proportions of your preference, either in <a
						href="/furniture">furniture</a>,
					curtains, or <a href="">rugs</a>. You can even add them in small details, like the <a
						href="/furniture/home-accents/decorative-pillows-and-blankets">accent pillow</a> covers, <a
						href="/furniture/home-accents/home-decor?type=lamps">lamps</a>, or other accent pieces. In the case of dark browns,
					they are tones that we can combine with gray successfully. These colors go with gray so well,
					because they bring a lot of warmth to it, something that gray lacks.
					<br/><br/>
					In the case of the mustard color, I can say that it combines very well with gray. Even with dark
					gray! Yes, it is possible to be a little afraid that its decorative force will eat up the light and
					diminish the space, but I assure you that the mustard color can counteract this effect. Even mustard
					tones add vitality to gray.
					<br/><br/>
					When this combination is purely two-tone, in addition to being warm, it is striking and modern. It
					is also a good resource to compensate for the lack of light in gray and bring it to life. It should
					be noted that, with accent pillows, <a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=art">wall art</a>, lamps, and other
					details you get that effect.
					<br/><br/>
					These tones have the great virtue of providing warmth without losing an iota of its sobriety. In
					addition to fabrics, we can also have this effect with natural fibers and leather. You can apply it
					on <a href="/furniture/living-room/living-room-furniture">sofas</a> or in small details that you add to the
					decoration.

				<p class="mt-3">
					It can be said that gray is a color that is somehow part of black itself, and both lack any
					saturation, and it is for this reason that I cannot find fault with this logic. I also think that
					the combination of these two colors will always be a total success.
					<br/><br/>
					Naturally, it is necessary to be careful in the way we apply it, since we run the risk of creating
					environments that are too dark or very sober, since they lack chromatic tonality. I think that among
					the colors that combine with gray, black is an elegant and timeless option. Of course, it can't be
					just any gray, I recommended a medium gray and that the touches of black be very controlled;
					although, I am aware that this also varies according to the taste of everyone.
					<br/><br/>
					If you prefer, there is also the option of using different tones within the same range, and it can
					turn out to be a guaranteed success if we include more than two tones. Adding some chrome
					accessories could give your home a very urban result.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3. GRAY AND WHITE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					It is a bright and natural combination, without complications. Combining gray with white results in
					a very well-matched couple that has been around for many years and will not go out of style.
					<br/><br/>
					It is awesome how bright the combination of dark gray with white can be. It is as if the white
					multiplied his powers. The result is modern! It is not a limited option, but can be applied in any
					space in the home, from the kitchen to the <a
						href="/furniture/living-room/living-room-furniture">living room</a> to the <a
						href="/furniture/bedroom/bedroom-furniture">bedroom</a>. It is undoubtedly a more current
					contrast.
					<br/><br/>
					This is a classic combination, but one that we could almost guarantee works in all styles. It is
					perfect because together they manage to stand out and define themselves within their subtleties. If
					you are looking for a color that matches gray, white never fails! In addition, it illuminates it and
					gives it freshness. Can you ask for anything better?

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4. GRAY WITH RED, MAGENTA, OR PINK</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					In my opinion, one way to give life to the gray color would be to combine it with any warm tone.
					Although it may seem a bit crazy, red is perfect for this. You can add it in small proportions
					through smooth and patterned accent pillows. It is better when the pillows are combined with other
					light tones, such as beige or white.
					<br/><br/>
					This will surprise you, but another color that combines perfectly with gray is magenta. It will
					bring warmth to gray, but it also provides a more elegant and modern look. A key point so that the
					combination does not eat up all the light, is to accompany them with light colors such as white or
					beige.
					<br/><br/>
					Another key point is that when we opt for a light gray, we find the advantages and disadvantages of
					neutral tones such as white and beige, which need a contrasting color so that they are not so
					simple. This is when we see how good it is to combine gray with pink and with warm materials like
					wood.

					I am sure that blue, in its lighter and darker variants, is a good companion to gray. It can bring a
					lot of freshness if you select light shades, while if you go for darker shades, it accentuates the
					elegant and sophisticated character. Now, the effect can be a bit cold, so it doesn't hurt to add
					wooden elements that give it the touch of warmth it needs. You can include it in a large piece, such
					as the sofa in the living room or the headboard in your bedroom. Then it includes textiles in
					lighter shades of blue and gray. Don’t forget to add elements in wood or natural fiber that provide
					warmth. Dark blue also works to give intensity without leaving the classic patterns to the
					combinations in the spaces of the home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					If you like the combination of a light gray and a delicate and aquatic green, let me tell you that
					these colors are perfect with wooden details in light tones. This is a combination that will give
					your home design a light and enveloping effect, and it works perfectly if it is combined with
					natural wood.
					<br/><br/>
					If you want a more informal and youthful effect, try combining the color gray with pastel tones such
					as aqua green. It helps to soften it, take away its seriousness and you will get a modern result.

					If you decide to decorate your home with gray tones, always keep in mind that the style changes
					completely if you want to combine a light or dark gray. Look at it this way, it can be cold when it
					starts to approach green and blue tones. Or warmer when it borders on beige and mustard tones.
					<br/><br/>
					Another important fact that you should not forget is that wood is perfect for ending this bad
					reputation that gray has for being too cold a color, and when it is combined a certain way, we give
					part of the prominence to wood.
					<br/><br/>
					To conclude, I think that one of the great virtues of gray tones is that they can be combined with
					practically any other color. Of course, it is the advantage of neutral tones. The effect achieved is
					different. Vibrant tones like red or turquoise will make it less serious and warm ones will bring
					light. But it also makes a very good pairing with the rest of the neutrals. Once again, I want to
					thank you for reading and I say goodbye until the next article.

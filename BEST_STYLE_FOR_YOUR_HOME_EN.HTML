				<p class="mt-3">
					The key to a classic interior is symmetry and order. The placement and style of your furniture is
					important. For example, setting up your living room decor facing a fireplace is one way. We
					associate the classic with what does not go out of style. If you like houses with high ceilings and
					elegant decor, that is part of the classic style. But even if your home doesn't have original
					moldings or chandeliers with high ceilings, you can have a <a
						href="/CLASSIC_STYLE_IN_INTERIOR_DECORATION">classic style</a> in your home.<br/><br/>Its
					indisputable timeless elegance is totally fashionable. It can adapt to the personality of those who
					will live in the home. This style is based on noble materials, in which baroque and rococo furniture
					stand out, luxurious floors, wall pieces, and a variety of accessories, but always with a balance
					that gives visual strength to the spaces.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Today's modern style is based on a design movement that was born in the early 20th century. It is
					simple and unadorned and at the same time very elegant. In fact, the design of all furniture and <a
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=decor">decor</a> must reflect its intended purpose. If a piece of
					furniture, decoration, or detail does not serve a practical purpose, then it can be
					removed.<br/><br/>In a house with this style, neutral colors will dominate. It is a style where lacquer covered wooden furniture and decor is very
					important, as are straight and pure lines.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Beams, wood, stone... If these elements are your favorites for home decor, the rustic style is in
					your DNA.<br/><br/>The essence of the rustic style is simplicity, naturalness, and roughness. The
					furniture does not have too much ornamentation. There is a lack of modern materials such as metal,
					plastic, and synthetic fabrics. The predominant colors are brown, green, beige, gray, and gold
					tones. The feeling of artisan creation must be in each of the pieces of furniture and decorative
					details that you incorporate into your <a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=rustic">rustic</a> interior design
					style. The environment has to be in harmony with nature.<br/><br/>The most important point is that
					this style can be combined with others.

				<p class="mt-3">
					<a href="/minimalist_interior_decoration_sp">Minimalist decor</a> never goes out of style. This
					style is characterized by its simplicity. Minimalist homes are committed to "less is more" so that
					each space is functional, without neglecting style.<br/><br/>This is a style that stands in
					contrast to the colorful pop art style. Functional, futuristic, and balanced. Given that minimalism
					picks up the baton of architectural rationalism, these three premises that define rationalism can
					also be applied to the style that concerns us. A minimalist home has the essential elements, without
					sacrificing style, to provide maximum practicality to the home without overloading it. Since the
					homes of yesteryear tended to “exceed”, minimalism relates to the future precisely because it
					dispenses with it.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">5.NORDIC STYLE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					This style in recent years has become a trend as it is gaining a lot of strength over time. The
					origin of this type of decoration is found in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, where sunny days
					are scarce for much of the year. A solution for replacing this lack of light was a need. The
					solution was to find light colors and some elements related to nature.<br/><br/>The ideal Nordic
					style comes from its focus on functionality, pragmatism, and clean aesthetics even with a minimalist
					bent. One of the things that I like the most about the Nordic style in interior decor is that it can
					be interpreted in many different ways, from a monochrome minimalist style to an eclectic style. The
					key is in the intermediate things and in the balance. The soft colors, pastel tones combined with
					old worn wood are important details in achieving a Nordic style in your home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Interestingly enough, in the 1950s, young people looking for growth in big cities like New York or
					Chicago had to start in places that years ago had been factories, so we’re talking beams, bricks,
					and concrete buildings.<br/><br/>In this time, the industrial style was adopted, and today,
					interior designers are inclined towards these elements in the decor that proudly shows the materials
					that others try to hide.<br/><br/>The furniture used in this style of decor is made of metal or
					iron, even on some occasions it can be seen with a little rust on them. Untreated wood and veneers
					are also used.<br/><br/>An important point to counteract coldness or dark tones is a large amount
					of natural light. The industrial style references a
					flexible design that is inspired by warehouses, factories, and other industrial structures.
					Industrial-style decor is comprised of minimalist architectural details that include the use of bare
					brick, metal, and wood, as well as reclaimed and recycled materials.

				<p class="mt-3">
					If you are a fan of the bohemian style, but its decorative exuberance stops you from adding it to
					your home, you can opt for boho chic. Find out what it has in common with Bohemians and why it's
					called chic.<br/><br/>The boho chic style definitely embraces the aesthetics of creative,
					carefree, and unconventional decoration. Its grace lies in the fact that it mixes different styles
					of decoration with a certain nonchalance.<br/><br/>If you look closely, few decorative styles are
					as cheerful, lively, and fun as the bohemian. It is a combination of vibrant colors, a fusion of
					cultures and eras, decorative freedom, and a mixture of styles. It is definitely a mix in which the
					hippy, the ethnic, and the oriental coexist, naturally creating a unique and very personal
					atmosphere.<br/><br/>I can honestly spend hours writing about the number of decorative styles that
					exist, like Mediterranean, <a href="/decorate_your_home_en">nautica</a>, farm house, and <a
						href="/romantic_style_home_en">romantic style</a> among many more. Without a doubt, however
					you choose to decorate your home will be a total success. The important thing is that you feel
					comfortable with your style of your preference. I hope this article brings you a little closer to
					finding the style for your home. Thank you very much for reading and goodbye until next time.

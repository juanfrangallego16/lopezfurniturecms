					It is true that the colors that are chosen for the decoration of a home say a lot about the
					personality of those who inhabit it. There is a wide variety of shades from which you can choose the
					ones that perfectly match your personality and style.<br/> We know that white is one of the most
					popular because it brings light to the spaces where it is used, but there are also other colors that
					can be adapted to achieve a much more welcoming and stylish space.<br/>Each color provides a
					different sensation, so it should be chosen considering our personal style, but also the space in
					which we will apply it. Keep in mind that painting a living room is not the same as a kitchen,
					neither is it the same to paint a narrow corridor than a large dining room.<br/>Dare to choose a
					new color for any of the spaces in your home. It is possible that after seeing some of the colors
					that are in trend this year you will want to paint your entire home again or at least some spaces
					that you want to highlight.<br/>When choosing the color for each wall, you must consider various
					aspects of the room and its function to find the ideal tone.<br/>Light colors are ideal for small,
					dimly lit spaces. While warm tones are ideal for creating cozy spaces and more saturated tones are
					great for impact and style. Define the needs of the space and your personal tastes to find the ideal
					color for each environment in your home.<br/>Today I bring you some colors that are in trend for
					this 2022 and their different applications in home spaces, considering their properties. Beautiful
					colors that will give your home style and personality.

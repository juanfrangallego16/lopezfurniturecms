					Autumn is here and with it come many changes! It is not only about turning our closet around, but
					also time to make some changes in our home to give it those autumnal touches so typical of this
					season.<br/>With the arrival of this season there are also changes in our routine, starting with
					swapping those tropical smoothies for a delicious cup of hot chocolate.<br/>For me, each season of
					the year is synonymous with renewal. It represents the end of one cycle and the beginning of
					another. The point is that fall is here, and with it came the perfect time to make some changes at
					home. Of course! I don't mean a complete home remodel. But if you think about it, sometimes a little
					detail can make a big difference.<br/>If you love candles as decorations, let me tell you that
					autumn is the ideal time to start decorating the home with candles. In addition to giving your home
					a warm touch, it is unquestionably a simple way to decorate and create a unique environment for you
					and your family.<br/>For this reason, I want you to focus on certain elements that will bring
					autumn to your home, whether it's painting a wall, buying a table, changing the chairs, or just
					selecting some cushions for your sofa set.<br/>If you decide to decorate your home this fall, you
					will be giving your home a more welcoming and pleasant touch; thus, achieving a space in which you
					will want to perpetuate your stay.<br/>When autumn arrives and temperatures begin to drop, the
					exterior of our home loses relevance, and it is the living room that begins to take center stage
					with those wonderful autumnal touches that make the environment of our home warmer and more
					pleasant.<br/>The important thing is that you enjoy the decorating process, and if you do it in the
					company of your family it can be a lot of fun.<br/>Ah! And don't forget that wood can play an
					important role in fall décor. So... without further ado, here are some tips to help you give your
					home an autumn touch.

				<p class="mt-3">
					There is no doubt that when decorating, colors are our best allies to define the decor and style of
					our home. For this reason, this fall I would recommend opting for neutral colors to paint the walls.
					You could even add a special touch by painting a wall with a more intense tone but that is according
					to the season.<br/><br/>At this time of year, the autumn colors bring a warm and pleasant
					atmosphere to the home, although for many, whites are the favorite. Gray tones have also been
					gaining ground.<br/><br/>As autumn arrives, warm colors are winning, but we can also see blue,
					green, pink tones, some touches of mustard color. Although the ones that never fail are the neutral
					tones.<br/><br/>Visualize your home as the perfect canvas on which you will capture your work of
					art by decorating each space in your home with beautiful autumn touches that suit your style and if
					you feel that you need help, it is valid to seek advice.

				<p class="mt-3">
					It is possible that during so many changes we can overlook some details that have relevance in home
					decor.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that you pay attention to the textures you will use to
					complement the autumn decor. This will help you when making the right selection of
					curtains.<br/><br/>Remember to keep in mind the style you want to maintain in your home and be
					consistent with the fabrics and colors of the curtains you choose. In other words, consider the
					decorative elements of your home. This way, you will surely achieve the effect you want to give to
					the different spaces of your home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					This is one of my favorite parts, because with a little creativity you can create beautiful
					arrangements that will bring life to the tables at home, from the dining table to the coffee
					table.<br/><br/>There are small details that will become your best allies when decorating the
					tables. You can use some candles in different sizes, colors, and textures, a vase, glassware, some
					flowers that are appropriate for this season of the year. Don’t miss some detail in the
					wood.<br/><br/>Try it out and prepare to be amazed at what you can achieve just by making a few
					changes or adding some elements to the decor. The important thing is that you manage to give a
					feeling of warmth to your home in a simple way and creating a pleasant and perfect environment for
					autumn.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4.BLANKETS AND PLAIDS</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					At this point, the mixture of textures is essential for the perfect fall decor. The blankets and
					plaids will become our best allies to spend the afternoon reading in our favorite reading
					corner.<br/><br/>You can change the light linen blankets that you used as summer decor for some
					wool or cotton that will provide the warmth you are looking for this season.<br/><br/>I'm sure
					you'll appreciate it when you sit on the couch in the late afternoon and take a few minutes to relax
					with your favorite book or show, complementing this moment with a delicious cup of hot
					chocolate.<br/><br/>Do not forget, autumn decor is the best when using soft textures that combine
					with the upholstery of the sofa or the cushions.

				<p class="mt-3">
					This is another key element for autumn decoration. There is no doubt that it is important to keep
					our feet pleasant and warm when the temperatures begin to drop.<br/><br/>In my opinion, rugs
					convey a pleasant feeling of comfort, softness, and warmth that fits perfectly with this season of
					the year.<br/><br/>Rugs are an excellent choice for decor, and it transforms the style of a room,
					becoming the soul of it on many occasions.<br/><br/>In addition, if you place a rug in the hall,
					in a corner, or in any strategic place in the home and place a table of some sort on it, it is sure
					that you will attract attention. This will also help you define spaces.<br/><br/>I hope you

					Avoid handling electrical cables without proper protection. If you need to touch an electrical cable
					it is recommended that you have dry clothes and hands, as well as it is good to keep in mind that it
					is better to wear shoes with rubber soles, insulating gloves. Among others, these are some important

				<p class="mt-3">
					One way to avoid electrical incidents that can harm the kids is to cover the holes in the outlet
					while they are not in use by using special plugs (as shown in the image). These plugs can be found
					at your local stores. What if you do not have any plugs or canâ€™t find them? In this case you can
					cover them with adhesive tapes.<br/><br/>However, if you are not satisfied with these options, you
					can replace the plugs in your home with child safe plugs. You can use Google search to find them
					near you.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.Unplug</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					It is important that small appliance hook ups are unplugged when they are not in use. When plugged
					in, even if not used, they consume a small amount of electricity.<br/><br/>Most small appliances
					have a pilot light or a timer that consumes electricity. For this reason, we recommend you get into
					the habit of unplugging them when they are not in use. This will help you see a decrease in your
					electricity bill each month. In addition, you will avoid major problems, in the event of a short
					circuit, electrical storms, etc.<br/><br/>Remember that you should never allow a plugged-in device
					to come in contact with water. In case a plug or power source gets wet, go to the switchboard and
					cut off the power flow to the entire home. Then, unplug the connected appliance and do not use the
					outlet again until it is completely dry.

				<p class="mt-3">
					As tempting as it may be to plug in or use multiple adapters to connect multiple electrical
					appliances at the same time, this is not recommended. This could trigger an electrical accident by
					overloading the outlet. Be aware that you can short-circuit or overheat the wiring.<br/><br/>It is
					very important that the cables are always in good condition. If there is one bulging or unprotected,
					it is best to replace them or cover them with an insulating tape.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Electrical repairs and renovations are tasks that should be carried out by an electrician. These
					professionals will guarantee that these jobs meet the established safety standards. It is best to
					leave things in the hands of certified people.<br/><br/>It is good to keep in mind that if at home
					you have an electrical appliance that shows failures or wear in its internal parts, it is best to
					replace it with a new one. Or you can seek the help of a professional who can repair the fault
					correctly.<br/><br/>To conclude, we recommend you hire a professional to perform electrical
					inspections throughout the home from time to time. Do not hesitate to replace appliances that are no
					longer safe. Keep in mind that you could be saving yourself more significant losses.<br/><br/>Take
					every precaution necessary and learn how to act in the face of a fire whose origin is an electrical
					defect. Remember that the main rule is you cannot pour water on it. In addition to having an
					evacuation plan, it is necessary to have a fire extinguisher at home.<br/><br/>Did you like this

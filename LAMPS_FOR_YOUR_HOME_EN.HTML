					For many, <a href="/appliances/home-appliances/lights?type=ceiling-lights">ceiling lamps</a> are one of the most attractive
					options from an aesthetic point of view. Whether you decide on recessed lighting or <a
						href="/appliances/home-appliances/lights">pendant lights</a>, it will undoubtedly be very important
					to consider the style of decoration you have at home.<br/>You can find great classic lamps such as
					chandeliers, lamps with metal structures that fit perfectly with urban and industrial styles, among
					others. Or simpler lamps that can serve both in a Nordic environment and in a minimalist
					space.<br/>Keep in mind that not all lamps have to be the focus of the room, so you can choose a
					lamp that provides supporting light or simply serves a decorative function.

				<p class="mt-3">
					We can say that the intention of these lamps is like that of the previous ones but with more
					illuminated presence. To choose the right <a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=floor+lamp">floor lamp</a> it is
					not enough to look at the design. The space where you place it, and its function are
					decisive.<br/>Due to their height, they are the best option to create positive environments. In the
					living room you will achieve a warm climate with a floor lamp and a fabric shade. Its light is
					important, but so is its design. Choose one that fits with the decoration in your home.<br/>This
					type of lamp can become your perfect company in the reading corner. Keep in mind that if the color
					of the lamp shade is darker, it can darken the space located around the light beam.<br/>There are
					floor lamps that have such a beautiful and slender shape that they become almost sculptural pieces
					that deserve a preferential space so that all eyes fall on them.

				<p class="mt-3">
					These types of lamps turn out to be discreet and can offer as much light as a ceiling lamp would. Of
					course, the effect is totally different because what is illuminated is the perimeter. They are
					perfect to be placed in a large room, but they are also an excellent option for a corridor or even
					on a terrace.<br/>They work perfectly as complementary lights, although there are models that can
					give as much light as a ceiling lamp. Defining the amount of light you want in that space, will help
					determine what wall lamp is best for your space.<br/>It is said that "the union is strength" I dare
					to say that it is also like that in terms of lighting. If your goal is to have a well-lit home, a
					good idea would be to combine several of the lighting options mentioned above. For example, standard
					sized rooms can be favored with three different light sources. However, larger rooms may require
					more points, while smaller rooms may not need more than one or two.<br/>Do not forget to also pay
					attention to the intensity of the light. It can be interesting to combine soft and strong lights.
					Always have a main focal point and let the rest be simply a secondary light to carry out specific
					activities.<br/>There are lamps that fit perfectly into any style of decoration. I must mention
					that this happens especially with the simplest lamps. But if, for example, you have decoration with
					a very marked style such as a rustic style, it may be better to go for a simpler or even classic
					lamp instead of selecting a modern style.<br/>If you need inspiration, I advise you to look for
					ideas on our website or in home decor magazines. Always remember that regardless of the lamps you
					choose, they must be in harmony with the environment they are a part of.<br/>When choosing the
					lamps that will illuminate your spaces you have two main focuses, to choose lamps that attract
					attention or lamps that will mix in with the rest of the decor. In both cases, the tone of light
					must be adequate, considering the activities that you will carry out in the space, so that your lamp
					can create the right atmosphere.<br/>I hope this article will serve as a guide for you to find the
					right lamps for your home. Thank you very much for reading and I say goodbye until the next article.

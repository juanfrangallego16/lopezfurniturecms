					Now that winter has arrived, it is necessary to make some changes in our home to give warmth and
					comfort to our home. I am 100% sure that the bedroom is the space that most appreciates these
					changes.<br/>To achieve sweet dreams at this time of year you will need some basic changes in the
					decoration of the bedroom. For example, bedding, blankets, duvets, rugs, and cushions, among others
					that will help you keep the cold away from the bedroom.<br/>My recommendation is that you do not
					use very vibrant shades in the bedroom. Remember that it is a space created to relax and unwind
					after day-to-day activities.<br/>Color theory is wise, and it is better to opt for some shades of
					brown, beige, white, grayscale, deep green, navy blue, among others.<br/>And of course, it is also
					time to take out the appropriate pajamas and slippers for this season of the year, in this way you
					will be in tune with the warmth of your bedroom.<br/>If you want to give it a special touch you can
					select a scent such as vanilla, cinnamon, lavender or the one of your preferences.<br/>You will see
					how when finishing all the details the results will be wonderful and gratifying. I am sure that you
					will fully enjoy the changes in the decoration.<br/>Without a doubt, you will manage to create a
					captivating space in which you will want to spend long winter nights.<br/>Today I bring you some
					very inspiring ideas so you can have a perfect bedroom for winter.

				<p class="mt-3">
					I am sure that there is no cozy room without bedding that provides warmth and is pleasant to the
					touch. Remember that it is not just about dressing your bedroom with style, but also that it is
					comfortable and pleasant, that it is a space that tuck you in and wrap you up, so you never want to
					leave the bedroom.<br/><br/>Bedspreads, wool blankets, and cotton or velvet accent pillows are
					perfect for turning your room into the coziest place in your home.<br/><br/>This season take all
					your heavy artillery out of the closet to protect yourself from the cold.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Sometimes I wonder what winter would be like without a rug under my feet. There is no doubt that
					rugs continue to be the perfect design accessory to add depth and warmth to the decoration of the
					bedroom. Also, is there anything more pleasant than waking up on a rug placed at the foot of the
					bed?<br/><br/>Just consider the style of your bedroom decoration when choosing the rug that will
					accompany you during the winter. It is better that it is thick to separate your feet from the cold
					ground and that it is soft and fluffy, to make it more pleasant.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Pillows and accent pillows are the best decor allies for winter, as they add points in terms of
					warmth and comfort. Choose them in different sizes, textures, and colors to maximize the focal
					effect and turn the bed into a true paradise of rest.<br/><br/>Although there is no secret formula
					to combine them, try to make them proportional to the size of the bed and the headboard. Place the
					largest behind and the smallest in front and combine some of them with the blankets.<br/><br/>The
					best option is to have different types of accent pillows, from rigid to others that make you feel as
					if you were on a fluffy cloud. These go well with your blankets and textures also play an important
					role. You will see that they give a unique look to the bedroom decor.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Warm tones are perfect for enveloping the room and enhancing a cozy and pleasant atmosphere, whether
					on the walls, bedroom furniture, or decorative accessories.<br/><br/>Don't forget pastel tones,
					they have been very fashionable since the explosion of the Scandinavian style, which also have the
					advantage of fitting in very well with warm colors.<br/><br/>White can also be a great ally and is
					perfect to combine with any color and all styles.

				<p class="mt-3">
					When it comes to decorating the bedroom, lighting is usually a secondary aspect for many, forgetting
					that if it is poorly lit, even the most beautiful room can be boring and cold. For this reason, it
					is important that you know that warm, low-intensity lighting will help you create the comfortable
					environment you are looking for this season. You can place spotlights such as lamps on the bedside
					table, among others.<br/><br/>Light plays an important role in our brain, because if you have warm
					and dimmed lights, you will create an ideal environment for relaxation.

				<p class="mt-3">
					There is no doubt that the textures are the ones that set the tone to give the magical touch that
					your bedroom needs during the winter.<br/><br/>The tendency to use the same fabric throughout the
					room is a very common decorating mistake. Don't be afraid of contrasts. This is the secret to
					correctly using the textures in all the different materials.<br/><br/>When you use different
					textures in fabrics, don't limit yourself to cushions and bedding, feel free. All textiles in the
					room must participate in the "game of textures": curtains, rugs, upholstery, among
					others.<br/><br/>Get ready with these winter textures! There are many alternatives to cope with
					the cold, but without losing style.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The windows become very cool because of the glass, especially if they are very large. For this
					reason, it is necessary to do something to isolate that small bit of cold generated by your
					windows.<br/><br/>Itâ€™s a good excuse to giving a cozier touch to the bedroom. If you like curtains
					you can use long ones with soft fabric like velvet. These would look great depending on your
					style.<br/><br/>If your style is more minimalist, my recommendation is that you decide on blinds
					that will help you fulfill the same mission of creating that warm environment in the
					bedroom.<br/><br/>We hope you enjoyed todayâ€™s article. See you next week as we bring you more tips
					on making your home a lovely place for you, your family, and your friends.

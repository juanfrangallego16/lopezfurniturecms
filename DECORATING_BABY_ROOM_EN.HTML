					If you are about to welcome a new member into the family, take a deep breath and don't panic because
					you will need to make some changes in your home. You’ll need to prepare the room for him/her, and I
					am sure that at this point you have many questions. What to do with the walls? Do you paint it, or
					do you use wallpaper, among many other questions that may arise?<br/>Organizing the room for the
					baby requires time, because there are many details that must be considered, such as the gender of
					the baby since this will help you when selecting the furniture, accessories, and the color palette
					for your decor.<br/>In the baby’s room, the details are very important since they will help you
					create a pleasant and cozy environment.<br/>Think of the nursery as the babies first window to the
					world. For this reason, it is important to add some visual, tactile, and sound stimuli to the
					decoration. Add music, stuffed animals, and rattles so that as he/she grows, they can explore the
					world through these objects. There are many decorative accessories with colors and sounds that will
					stimulate the baby's senses.<br/>Here are some points that will help you make the right decision
					when decorating the room for the new member of your family.

					From my point of view, the room for a baby should be cozy and very pleasant so that the little one
					can rest, play, and feel stimulated by their environment.<br/><br/>In the decoration of the baby's
					room, white and pastel colors should not be lacking, although; it can also be decorated with neutral
					tones without losing an iota of sweetness.<br/><br/>You can incorporate the brightest colors in
					some accessories, toys or any other object that will help you visually stimulate the baby’s senses,
					without abusing them since the little one also needs to rest, and it is not a secret that colors
					influence their mood.<br/><br/>A very important point to keep in mind is that the paint you use
					should be ecological or water-based, so that it does not release toxins into the environment.

				<p class="mt-3">
					When it comes to the walls, you should stay away from the colors that are very strident. Remember
					that the purpose of the decoration for the baby's room is to provide good rest.<br/><br/>You could
					choose neutral colors that do not exhaust you over time. If you choose to wallpaper it, timeless
					patterns such as florals or botanical details can work perfectly, always in soft tones of course.
					The wallpaper gives personality to the decoration.<br/><br/>Some other wallpaper options could be
					drawings of clouds, birds, raindrops, and many more. The truth is that your options are endless. I
					can assure you that any of these details are worth it, since the result will be a sweeter, more
					magical, and more beautiful room.<br/><br/>One way to add color to the nursery is by creating a
					focal wall. Just keep in mind that the color adapts to the decoration and the amount of natural
					light in the space.<br/><br/>If you have an artistic streak, you can create a mural with paint for
					the prominent wall of the room. Find a theme that you like and use colors according to the
					decoration to integrate it perfectly.

				<p class="mt-3">
					In this, the leading role during the first months is played by the crib. Remember that it must
					provide safety and comfort to the baby. From the presence of bars to a protector that surrounds the
					crib, there are many details that as parents we cannot ignore during this first
					stage.<br/><br/>Selecting an armoire to complement the decoration of the room is essential. Using
					some auxiliary furniture with wheels could also work for you.<br/><br/>It would also be a good
					option to place a complete wardrobe from floor to ceiling since with this you will have more storage
					space, and we must not forget that the baby will grow quickly and as time progresses you will see
					the need to make small changes to the room so that your little one has a beautiful space suitable
					for each of his/her stages.<br/><br/>A seriously recommend you focus on light colors like white.
					Believe me this never fails when it comes to decorating the baby's room.<br/><br/>To have all the
					baby's things in perfect order, you can help yourself with all kinds of resources, from the classic
					armoire to some baskets, minimalist drawers, and multipurpose cabinets in which you can store their
					clothes, diapers, hygiene products, toilet, amongst others.<br/><br/>I encourage you to add a
					single chair to the decoration. There are so many chair options that I am sure you’ll be able to
					find one that goes well with the decoration in the babies bedroom.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Rugs are important accessories for the decoration of the baby's room. It will add warmth and texture
					to the space, it can be very helpful in the stage in which the little one begins to play on the
					floor.<br/><br/>You could use a decorative fluffy rug throughout the space and on top add some
					didactic mat that combines well with the decoration. I can assure you that your baby will thank
					you.<br/><br/>To protect the health of your baby, you should not skimp on expenses when it comes
					to textures. Choose organic cotton for the clothes in his/her crib and decorate with natural fiber
					rugs where he/she can sit and play safely. You can place several cushions around to make it more
					comfortable.

					Your little one should be able to have enough space to start developing their imagination during
					playtime. Think carefully about what furniture and what elements you are going to add to the décor.
					It is better not to load the room too much because, as our little one grows, he/she will accumulate
					toys and items.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that these little tips help you create the ideal room so
					that you can welcome the new member of your family. And if you do it with love, I am sure that you

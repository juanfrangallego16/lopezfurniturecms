					Do you like decorations with nautical or navy styles? Let me tell you that this style in addition to
					looking super good, provides a feeling of harmony and placidity in each of the spaces of the home.
					It is the combination of the white and blue colors that can achieve this pleasant effect. Quite
					simply, these shades provide a sensation of freshness and relaxation that is totally palpable and
					transmitted throughout the home.<br/>You just need a few special touches to give your home the
					breath of the sea. So, take note and choose to decorate your space with this fabulous style that we
					like.<br/>A style in which the colors of the sea, blue, white, and turquoise are especially
					abundant. They bring us to relaxation and fresh places.<br/>To achieve the nautical style, it is
					not necessary that you make big changes. Rather, you should opt for simple decor and warm
					colors.<br/>The blue color and stripes are especially important in this sailor style. Some may say
					it is one of the main characteristics.<br/>If you have the advantage of having large windows, it is
					ideal that the lighting in your home comes from natural light. In addition, you can complement it
					with the use of curtains in earth colors. If it is in your liking, you can opt for curtains with
					marine motifs.<br/>Small details like cushions, centerpieces, and tablecloths can add that extra
					touch to your decor. To have the nautical or navy style, you can use covers with marine motifs or
					colors that remind you of the beach and create centerpieces in which you place stars, bamboo sticks,
					seashells and stones. Use a transparent container to place them and voila, you have a centerpiece
					with sea motifs.<br/>With the materials that you use to make the centerpiece, you can also decorate
					candles and do any decorative project that allows you to incorporate these objects. If you want to
					include the youngest in your home in the creative process, you can ask them to make a collage with
					these materials, which can later be used to decorate the wall of their room.<br/>Unleash your
					creativity and put into practice the tips that we will give you below. You will see how fun it is to
					create this style in your home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					In the nautical or navy style, blue and white reign without question. But that does not mean that
					you cannot integrate other colors to the decoration such as red or yellow in different accessories
					that serve as complements.<br/><br/>In this style, it is good to use the wide palette of blue
					tones, which are very relaxing and spatial colors for a warm climate like that of a beach
					house.<br/><br/>For the walls, always use colors such as white and light bluely. In some cases,
					use blue just to highlight a wall. Deep, darker colors are excellent for upholstery, fabrics, and
					accessories.<br/><br/>A key point would be to cover a wall with white wood in the bedroom, in the
					hallway, or in the kitchen. They will help you create the effect of being in the cabin of a ship.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Textiles are a quick and sometimes inexpensive way to give your living room or bedroom decor a spin.
					Textiles with marine striped motifs or with motifs such as starfish, anchors, or corals are
					perfect.<br/><br/>Stripes are always present in this style, and it is in the upholstery where we
					can include those stripes. Stripes are usually of blue or red tones combined with
					white.<br/><br/>Rustic furniture made of light or dark wood, suits this style very well. It makes
					a perfect match with the fabrics we mentioned above or with rustic furniture painted in
					white.<br/><br/>For curtains, the light fabrics in white allow the passage of light favoring the
					interior lighting during the day. It can have a border line or detail in blue to integrate with the
					rest of your home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The accessories in the nautical style decor are the key to give the final touch to any space. You
					can decorate your home with corals, shells, starfish, lighthouses, rudders, anchors, and
					nets.<br/><br/> Choose the pieces of this decoration well so that your home can feel like the sea
					and the beach. Of course, try not to overdo it. It is better to be subtle with a few small details
					avoiding your home to become a museum of the sea.<br/><br/>Strings are a classic in nautical
					decoration. In addition, there are an infinite number of ways to integrate them into the decoration.
					How about using some strings in the bathroom to hang towels or to frame a mirror? It would be
					perfect.<br/><br/>A centerpiece cannot be absent at the dining table, on the terrace, or in some
					corner of your home. If you want, you can place a vase, a fountain, white stones, a candle, sea or
					shells as your centerpiece. Just let your creativity fly and you will love the result. Take into
					account that in this style natural materials are a plus.<br/><br/>Furniture and accessories in
					materials such as rattan or wicker are a plus when it comes to decorating the home in the purest
					nautical style.<br/><br/>Did you like this article? If so, share it on your social networks and

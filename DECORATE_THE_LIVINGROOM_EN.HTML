				<p class="mt-3">
					This is one of the most important interior design trends of the 20th century. Art Deco is
					indisputably a symbol of glamor and sophistication.<br/><br/>We must mention that within its
					fundamental characteristics is the trend towards geometric lines, in particular rectilinear lines,
					and monochrome palettes.<br/><br/>The key is to achieve a good contrast between light, dark, or
					bright colors, such as red, blue, or yellow.<br/><br/>You can never miss elements such as
					geometric prints in bright colors because these are spaces loaded with modern decor, that evoke an
					extravagant glamor. Dare to try it! This style will make you fall in love.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">2.Industrial Style</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					This style is also known as urban; it is inspired by a warehouse or a loft in big
					cities.<br/><br/>A curious fact is that in the 50s, young people in search of growth in big cities
					like New York or Chicago had to start in places that years ago had been factories. So this means
					that beams, bricks and concrete were abundant.<br/><br/>In this way, this style was adopted, and
					today interior designers are inclined towards these elements in the decoration that proudly show the
					construction materials that others try to hide.<br/><br/>The furniture that is used in the
					decoration style is made of metal or iron and sometimes can be seen with a little rust on them.
					Untreated woods and veneers are also used.<br/><br/>There are two decorative pieces you cannot
					miss, paintings and photographs. They add a touch of color to an environment with opaque or pale
					colors.<br/><br/>To counteract coldness or dark tones, a great entrance of natural light is
					necessary.

				<p class="mt-3">
					This style in recent years has become a trend that has gained a lot of strength over time. The
					origin of this type of decoration is in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, where sunny days are
					scarce for much of the year, so a way was sought to replace that lack of light. The solution was
					found in light colors and some elements related to nature.<br/><br/>If you look at it carefully
					you will notice that the nature of the forest and mountains are the main inspiration for this style.
					You will see that in most cases there is furniture or wooden elements in the middle of light gray
					walls, similar color to the sky of those countries.<br/><br/>In addition to the colors, the
					furniture stands out for its simplicity and straight lines that give a distinctive touch to the
					space. In the rest of the decoration, green plants and flower patterns dominate. Although, lately
					the use of geometric figures such as squares, and vertical lines has been seen.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4.Farmhouse or country house Style</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The intention of this style is to bring nature inside the home to create rural houses that transmit
					harmony, well-being, and comfort. If the house has old elements, it is important to maintain that
					character.<br/><br/>As you will see, these are mainly cool spaces with warm elements. In other
					words, walls in cold tones that provide luminosity, with warm colors. I think there is no better way
					to explain it.<br/><br/>Although stone and wood floors and furniture are favorites, there are a
					variety of natural materials that go very well with this style. The elements that are essential for
					this style are wood, stone, clay, wicker, and ceramic. Let your imagination fly and create the best
					country house style so that you can enjoy it as a family.

				<p class="mt-3">
					We cannot deny that balance is the key in this type of decoration that has spread throughout the
					world, lovers of this style seek to create atmospheres of peace and balance in their
					homes.<br/><br/>Traditionally the predominant materials are bamboo, stone, rice paper, cedar wood,
					and silk. The colors of these elements are contrasted with the walls. In most cases are white or
					light tones, such as beige and some dare to add some red.<br/><br/>As you can see in this style
					there is a lot of similarity with minimalism, but there is usually a few more decorative elements or
					plants that create the feeling of tranquility and balance to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Nature is
					important for this type of decoration. Artificial lighting is usually warm, in such a way that it
					resembles the rays of the sun, very in sync with the culture of the rising sun.<br/><br/>Did you

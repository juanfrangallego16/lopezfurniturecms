					Making the right selection of a pendant light, also known as ceiling lamp, for the living room is
					important when defining the style based on the decor in your home. There are many points that must
					be considered to make the best selection, such as: size and location, among others.<br/>Pendant
					lights attract a lot of attention, and I would even dare to say that on many occasions they do so
					more than other elements in our decor.<br/>When it comes to the elements that will be a part of the
					living room of our home, it is normal to prefer unique elements. In this case a pendant light with a
					unique design, or at least one that has personality and style in line to the decoration of our
					home.<br/>Of course, we cannot ignore that it must fulfill the function of providing good lighting
					to one of the most important spaces in our home.<br/>At this point I think it is very important to
					stop for a moment and ask ourselves two questions that will help us:<br/>What effect do we want the
					lighting to have in our living room? Do we want the pendant light to go unnoticed or to have a
					leading role in the room?<br/>It is important that you carefully select a light that matches the
					decoration of your living room and your tastes. Today I will share 4 points to help you choose the
					perfect pendant light for your living room.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Defining the space in the room where our pendant light will go is very important. Do not limit
					yourself at this point! Keep in mind that the pre-existing lighting point in the room does not have
					to coincide with the ideal space for your project. If you need to change it, feel free to do
					so.<br/><br/>In fact, if you need to, you can ask for the help of a professional to make some
					adjustments to the ceiling and install it in another area or hang a cord-type cable to carry
					electricity to another point.<br/><br/>This type of installation is perfect if your living room
					idea coincides with vintage decoration, industrial decoration, or a retro style.<br/><br/>If you
					have a living-dining room, my recommendation is that you have individual lighting for each of the
					areas or determine in which part you put downlights and in which a ceiling lamp with more style.

				<p class="mt-3">
					There is no doubt that the size of the lamp must have a certain proportion with the surface of the
					room and the area it will occupy. What do I mean by this? It is important to consider if the area
					where it will be located has a single sofa. If it is in front it will have a television, if it has
					two sofas, consider if they are at an angle or in front of each other.<br/><br/>Of course,
					everything will also depend on our tastes when deciding, whether it is a lamp that has a leading
					role, that is large and striking, or a smaller one that in a certain way goes a little
					unnoticed.<br/><br/>A very important point to consider is the height of the ceilings in case you
					are looking for a ceiling lamp for a living room with very high ceilings, for a modern loft-type
					home, or for any other type and style of living room.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Yes, I know, this seems so obvious, since the function of a pendant light is to “illuminate”, but it
					goes further.<br/><br/>Any lighting project contemplates more than one point of light. To choose
					suitable living room lighting, it is necessary to consider whether spotlights or downlights will
					also be used as support, if there will be ambient lighting along the walls of the living room,
					semi-hidden behind a perimeter molding, if the pendant light is going to be used only on special
					occasions for lunch or dinner in the living room, or if you only want it to create certain effects
					or shadows.

				<p class="mt-3">
					It is not a secret that there is a wide variety of lamps on the market, and many of them with very
					marked characteristics of certain styles such as: modern, vintage, industrial, classic, rustic and
					many more.<br/><br/>You need to be clear about what style you want to give to your decor or if
					what you want is to make a mixture of different styles. Defining this point can help you identify
					the type of lamp you need to decorate your living room.<br/><br/><br/>Have you ever had doubts
					when choosing a pendant light for the living room? Don't worry, I think this can happen to many of
					us since a simple change in the lighting can completely alter the atmosphere of a room and turn it
					from a boring space to a cozy and pleasant interior.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that lighting is
					very important in any area of the home and that it deserves attention when
					decorating.<br/><br/>When you begin to delve into home decoration, you will realize that it is the
					small details in the decoration that make the difference. It is true that the style and color scheme
					define the space, but it is the lighting that sets the mood.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that
					when selecting the lamps or any accessory that is part of the decoration, do not do it in a hurry,
					take your time, this requires time and patience. This way you ensure that you are comfortable with
					the selection you make, and you will be less likely to regret it after a while.<br/><br/>For me,
					the style of the lamp should follow the line of the decoration of your room, remember that if you
					decide to give it prominence, it will become the focal point of the room.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3"> Here I give you some tips that I am sure will help you with the selection of your
					pendant light/ceiling lamp for your living room:
				<ul>
					<li>Rustic decoration: wrought iron lamps, wood, among others.</li>
					<li>Modern decoration: Lamps with daring and unconventional shapes, those made of stainless steel
						would not be bad.</li>
					<li>Classic decoration: Chandeliers with crystals or other materials such as wood or porcelain.</li>
					<li>Boho decoration: Lamps made of natural materials such as rattan or raffia in colors present in
						nature such as green or a tan tone.</li>
					<li>Vintage decoration: Lamps with an aged finish and an exposed Edison-type light bulb.</li>
					<li>Nordic decoration: Light lamps with geometric shapes, made of wood or metal. In fact, the lamp
						could be used to add some color to this style of decoration.</li>
					<li>Industrial decoration: metal lamps in black, grey, brown, or with an aged appearance.</li>
				</ul>
				To finish, I want to remind you that pendant lights look good in any room and the most important thing
				when selecting one is that it is to your liking, at the end of it all you are the one who will enjoy it
				daily.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that this article will help you find the right pendant light for you.

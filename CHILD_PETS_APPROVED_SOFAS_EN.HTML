					On many occasions the sofa becomes the protagonist in the decoration of the living room. In fact,
					the pieces that complement the decoration of the living room are chosen considering the model of
					sofa that has been selected to decorate our living room.<br/>The choice of sofa is very important
					and much more so when there are children or pets at home. Based on this, the selection criteria is
					broadened because it is necessary to consider the practicality and easy maintenance of the selected
					sofa.<br/>It is true that having pets at home is a very pleasant experience since they are good
					companions. Pets are part of the family and are almost always around the house.<br/>At home we have
					three beautiful dogs that we rescued from the street and took them in temporarily while we found
					them a home. I can say that they don't leave home anymore, they have become part of the family and
					although at first it was difficult to adapt because they used to love to climb on the sofa. They
					still do today, but they don't try to destroy them anymore, they just like to lay on
					them.<br/>Having children and pets at home has its benefits: they improve empathy, fill our hearts
					with joy, and help us stay more active. But the advantages are reduced when we focus on the
					relationship with decoration. Keeping the house impeccable becomes complicated.<br/>Today I bring
					you some important points that you should consider when choosing a sofa for your home if you have
					children or pets at home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					My recommendation is that you opt for a sofa set with fabric that is easy to clean and keep in
					optimal condition. Remember that on the sofa you will spend pleasant moments sharing with your
					family, including pets, so opt for an upholstery that is firmly sewn and has a smooth surface, as
					they are easier to clean in case the children spill something on the furniture. But of course, they
					are the most durable against pet claws.<br/><br/>You can opt for a tightly woven fabric. At the
					same time, it is also important that it has a percentage of synthetic fiber, which makes it easier
					to clean, it does not shrink, and does not fade.<br/><br/>With children it is more reasonable to
					opt for a fabric sofa, instead of a leather one; although, this option should not be ruled out.
					Leather is easy to clean, it is also elegant and perfect for decorating any room.<br/><br/>Of
					course, you will have to take care of scratches and small scratches as they can leave marks, but
					with a good treatment to remove and treat scratches, everything will be solved.<br/>In addition to
					natural fabrics, also consider synthetic ones, such as microfibers, which are generally solid, not
					dirty, and sometimes can even be put in the washing machine.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">2.VELVET “NOT A GOOD IDEA”</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Although velvet is in trend, the truth is that it is not highly recommended for a home with children
					and much less with pets, since it is somewhat delicate, allows stains to penetrate and is difficult
					to clean.<br/><br/>But if you like that texture, opt for smooth chenille’s, which imitate it very
					well and can survive a children's party at home.<br/><br/>They are beautiful and elegant. But in a
					home with children and pets it is not the most suitable. If liquids fall on it or your cat digs in
					its nail, it will be a total disaster. Better use washable fabric sofas in dark colors, such as
					brown or medium gray.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The models with covers allow you to wash cushions and backrests when you need it. Of course, first
					check that the fabric contains polyester and be careful with cotton and linen, which can
					shrink.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful option to buy sofas with washable covers, since the covers can
					be removed and washed as many times as you want; in the washing machine, by hand or be sent to dry
					cleaning, if the fabric is very delicate.<br/><br/>You can also opt for a quilted cover that goes
					over the seat cushion and allows children or your pet not to be in direct contact with the
					upholstered sofa. In this way, we will avoid several headaches by simply having to remove the sofa
					cover to wash it, without further complications.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Go for darker colors, avoid white as it can tarnish easier. Another option is the intermediate
					shades, so that they do not mark the decoration excessively.<br/><br/>Just as important as its
					upholstery and padding is the frame. Those made of solid wood, steel, or aluminum are good options.
					If you want to know if it is resistant or not, raise one of its legs 15 cm from the ground and check
					that the other leg is stable, and the sofa does not tilt.<br/><br/>Yes, you have small children
					and pets, you must adapt your lifestyle to the reality of your home. That is why you will not always
					be able to incorporate certain innovations in the sector into your decoration because they do not
					fit with the functionality you need. This does not mean that you have a mess in your home. No! It's
					just about striking a balance between aesthetics and practicality.<br/><br/>With these tricks, the
					coexistence between decoration, children and pets will be more placid. In the end, these
					"sacrifices" are well worth it.<br/><br/>And if you cannot resist some of these trends, you know:
					to take extreme precautions and that is what God wants.<br/><br/>Remember, choosing the materials
					well and seeking a balance between the aesthetic and the practical are the keys to a happy
					coexistence.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that this article will help you and that you can find the
					sofa that your child, you, and your pet need. Thanks for reading! I say goodbye until the next
					article.

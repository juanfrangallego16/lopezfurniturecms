				<p class="section-header mt-3">1.A BED DRESSED IN LAYERS</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The leading role in a luxurious hotel room has to be the bed, most of the time. An excellent idea is
					to dress it in layers with a sheet, top sheet, <a
						href="/furniture/home-accents/decorative-pillows-and-blankets?type=throws">blanket</a>, <a
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=quilt">quilt</a> or <a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=duvet">duvet</a>, <a
						href="/furniture/home-accents/decorative-pillows-and-blankets?type=pillows">some pillows</a>, decorative cushions, and blankets for a
					sophisticated touch.<br/><br/>You may have noticed that a key element of hotels is the use of
					white sheets. These convey the feeling of peace, cleanliness, and relaxation, in addition to
					bringing freshness to any room. You can play a little with the color in the comforter or duvet, but
					always keep in mind that they must match the rest of the decoration in your bedroom.<br/><br/>I
					also want to mention and address the comfortable <a
						href="/mattresses/mattress">mattresses</a>
					of excellent quality most hotels have. A good quality mattress is the avenue to the best night
					sleep. Lay down a new set of freshly laundered and pressed sheets. Take your time to place them
					well. A trick seen in hotels is that after placing the fitted sheet, place the top sheet, leaving
					about 20 inches hanging from the top of the bed. Then place the blanket, comforter, or duvet on top.
					The end of the sheet that is reserved on top can be used to make the upper envelope. You proceed to
					adjust all the ends and voila! Remember that a nice bed is always covered with a few cushions and
					the pillows you use to sleep on.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The <a href="/furniture/bedroom/bedroom-furniture?type=nightstands">nightstands</a> or bedside tables are
					infallible. It is not only decorative, but also functional. One mistake some people make is
					overloading their nightstands with unnecessary items and end up with a messy
					table.<br/><br/>Nightstands don't need much. They are perfect for placing small lamps and storing
					those objects that we always want to have in hand at bedtime. In short, they are tables that offer
					us not only aesthetics but also comfort.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.SELECT A NEUTRAL COLOR PALETTE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					It is true that most luxury hotels use neutral colors in the rooms, because this provides a sense of
					tranquility, good taste, and good rest.<br/><br/>Getting the right selection of colors for the
					room is very important to achieve the goal we are looking towards. I can even say that the color of
					the room is paramount. Keep in mind that neutral colors convey tranquility and serenity, and it
					should be noted that the place where you can feel this in a more tangible way is in a
					bedroom.<br/><br/>The neutral color palette goes beyond the walls. You will find that the curtains
					and upholstery also complement each other perfectly to create a calm space where you can rest after
					a long day.

				<p class="mt-3">
					It's not just the bedding and décor that makes a five-star hotel feel so luxurious. It’s also all
					the little details that are a part of the bedroom. For the decorative elements you can add <a
						href="/furniture/dining-room/dining-room-furniture?type=mirrors">mirrors</a> with frames, <a
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=art">paintings</a>, or <a
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=sculpture">sculptures</a>. The key is to infuse the atmosphere with
					harmony through the decor, without over saturating the space. I think the secret is in the details.
					Anything that makes you happy and improves your mood deserves a place in your room, whether it's art
					or decoration. Surround yourself with things that make you smile.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The <a href="/furniture/home-accents/home-decor?type=lamps">lamps</a> on the nightstands are must. There is no doubt, they
					are indisputably necessary. A viable option would be to choose strategically placed recessed lights
					to illuminate areas of your bedroom. Remember that the light must be soft and warm.<br/><br/>On
					the other hand, hanging <a href="/appliances/home-appliances/lights?type=ceiling-lights">lamps</a> will give a more
					luxurious look to your bedroom. Another option is to place a dimmer so you can adapt your lights to
					any occasion.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Curtains are essential in hotels to block light in the room and thus provide a restful sleep. A good
					idea is to place two sets of curtains, an internal one with a fabric that prevents the passage of
					sunlight and an external one that serves as accent to the rest of your decor. You can even leave
					some leftover fabric to bunch up on the floor.<br/><br/>Modify the appearance of your bedroom by
					incorporating a <a href="/search?type=rugs&page=1&limit=12&search=rug">rug</a>. This point is a way to give a cozy touch to
					the room as well as giving you a soft place to step on each morning and night. There is a wide
					variety of rugs for you to get crazy with your selection.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Sometimes all you need is a change of scenery to make your bedroom feel more luxurious. You can
					achieve this by changing the arrangement of the furniture in your room. Think outside the box, you
					can try placing the bed in front of a window. Who knows? It can work! Or even placing it at an
					angle. The important thing is not to keep your ideas hidden, but instead put them into practice and
					try different options. This will bring you closer to reaching your goal.<br/><br/><br/>As I
					mentioned before, luxury hotel rooms are designed to provide you with a space where you can relax
					and enjoy a good night's sleep while away from home.<br/><br/>They definitely prioritize comfort
					with items like freshly laundered bedding, fluffy pillows, and soft <a
						href="/furniture">furnishings</a>,
					in addition to a nice decoration. These elements combine to promote your relaxation, help you to
					dissipate the stress of travel, and this makes the room a pleasant destination.<br/><br/>You can
					replicate the same relaxing environment in your own room without the expense of expensive travel.
					The trick is to place a variety of luxurious items, such as bedding, pillows, and rugs, to make the
					space as inviting as possible. Fresh scents and proper arrangement of bedroom furniture also help
					create a five-star hotel feel.<br/><br/>Implement these ideas in your bedroom or even if you have
					a guest room you can apply them there, to give a first-class treatment. Once again, thank you very
					much for reading and see you in the next article.

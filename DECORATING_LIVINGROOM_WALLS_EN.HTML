				<p class="mt-3">
					I'm one of those people who think that new paint can do wonders. If you decide to paint the walls in
					your home, I recommend choosing a tone that stands out to paint a focal wall in the living room, it
					is a very simple resource, but I am sure it will give you great results.<br/><br/>There are those
					who choose to highlight the wall behind the largest sofa, since in this way they make the furniture
					stand out in the living room. Especially if dark tones are chosen for the wall and light tones for
					the furniture.

				<p class="mt-3">
					A wonderful way to add design to your walls quickly is by placing a wallpaper that you like and that
					fits perfectly with your decoration. As in the previous point you can create a focal wall, or place
					it on all walls, for maximum effect.<br/><br/>In addition to wallpaper, vinyl, and wood accents,
					there are other types of self-adhesive textured coatings to decorate your home. You can find siding
					sheets that look like brick or even stone. These plates are glued on the wall directly and generate
					a very original effect both visually and to the touch. With this idea you can achieve those white
					brick walls that you like so much.<br/><br/>With any of these options you will achieve a
					spectacular view, and I assure you that it will be much more intense if you only apply some of these
					options on a focal wall.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that wood is a material that cannot lack in
					your decor. It can be combined with warm or cold colors and is suitable for all styles of
					decoration. Therefore, it is a good ally. You just must choose the right wood for the style that
					suits you best.

					Wall molding can instantly elevate the decorative style and you can be sure that it is a great way
					to keep the walls of your living room blank and add some relief to it that will add a touch of
					interest.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that adding moldings to the walls is an excellent option to
					give your living room a classic and vintage look. These elegant finishes have proven to be more than
					just a way to hide a damaged wall. Dare to decorate the walls with moldings and I am sure that you
					will love the result.

				<p class="mt-3">
					I can say that this is one of my favorite options. Selecting a good size painting that stands out in
					the middle of the decoration is an excellent idea to decorate your living room with.<br/><br/>If
					you have several works that you want to exhibit, you can create a small gallery on one of the walls.
					In this case, my recommendation would be that you consider the relationship of the colors between
					the works of art and the rest of the decoration.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of symmetry, a gallery
					with paintings of the same size and some color as a focal wall may be your best option. It will be
					even better if the paintings are related in some way. If they are all a part of a series, it would
					be wonderful. You will see that it will a good conversation starter.

				<p class="mt-3">
					You could select some photos of special moments and use them to decorate the walls of your living
					room. A good idea is to hang large photographs on the wall, unifying them in some way. Even if you
					prefer, you could choose to put black and white photos.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that we all
					love photographs, especially when we have accumulated many that transport us to happy times, to
					special occasions that we always love to remember.<br/><br/>It is a good idea if you want to keep

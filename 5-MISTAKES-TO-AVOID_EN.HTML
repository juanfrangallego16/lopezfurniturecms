					Our home decor is very personal, but to a certain extent it is necessary to follow some universal
					guidelines so that we do not have to regret when we are done decorating. Skimping on some things or
					exceeding others can have consequences that we can regret in the short or long term. I think that
					the objective of many is to have a functional home, that is truly to our liking and in addition,
					reflects who we are. I am sure that nobody wants to make decorative mistakes, but it is inevitable
					to make some. Decorating a home or a space is not an easy task, so it is not a bad idea to start
					this process with a little advice on the subject.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					In this article, I want to point out some of the most common mistakes that we should consider before
					starting to decorate our home. Finding balance can be complex, but it is a very important point to
					achieve our goal. We are so used to some styes that we keep repeating them even though styles have
					changed, and decoration trends have advanced. Impulse purchases, poorly placed lights, colors that
					do not combine... Have you made a mistake too? Do not get overwhelmed, there is no mistake with no
					solution. These are 5 mistakes you should avoid when decorating your home.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">1. NOT PLANNING</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The main step when decorating is to be clear about what you are wanting to achieve, and for that it
					is essential to have a plan. Some people are not sure which style they like best. That does not mean
					that they lack their own opinion, we could say that they simply have not prioritized their
					preferences.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					My recommendation is to plan your desired style as a combination of your entire home. With this I do
					not mean that all spaces are the same, but it is a good idea that they have certain decorative
					elements that relate them. The fact that they share a wooden floor, carpentry, and color scheme will
					give your home a sense of unity. Of course you can also customize them with the <a class=""
						href="/furniture">furniture</a>
					and <a class="" href="/furniture/home-accents">accents</a>.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">2. NOT TAKING YOUR LIFESTYLE INTO ACCOUNT</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					It’s not just about decorating a beautiful space, ideally it needs to be functional. If not, what
					would be the point? It is important to ask yourself the right questions before you start decorating
					your spaces.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					For example, do you have pets? Have children? Do you like a reading space? How many people will
					occupy the home? Do you host many family and social gatherings? Do you want a comfortable home to
					isolate yourself from the outside world? There are many questions that you should ask yourself
					before decorating. This will help you define and prioritize all the details of the decoration.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					My recommendation is that you do not try to live in a space that does not suit your lifestyle. I
					think that the perfect pieces of furniture are those that are decorative and practical at the same
					time.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					Yes, the aesthetic is important, but it is not the only thing that must be considered. Before you go
					shopping, be clear about your budget and what you need. Remember to prioritize quality over
					quantity.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3. EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF PICTURES AND ART</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If you like to add photos to the decor, go ahead. Photos create that feeling of home that many of us
					seek. Instead of a large portrait, consider making a collage of smaller photos. You can be
					surrounded by all your memories and loved ones in a more elegant and less intrusive way.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					Don't go overboard with the pictures and <a class=""
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=wall+art">wall art</a>. Keep in mind that these harmonize the
					spaces in their proper measure. From a small painting on a large wall to a voluminous painting on a
					very small wall, the paintings you choose should be well placed, harmonize with the space, and not
					cluttered.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4. INADEQUATE LIGHTING</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Adding light in a strategic place can visually add meters of amplitude to any space. Also, keep in
					mind that light influences our mood, so it is a key point to decorate. Remember that the room, the
					study, the dining room, or bedroom follow different guidelines. These spaces will need different <a
						class="" href="/furniture/home-accents/home-decor?type=lamps">lamps</a> and possibly different light
					intensity.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					There is no doubt that decoration and lighting go hand in hand. If you create a reading area, but
					you have not foreseen a point of light, you have a problem that you can only solve with wires. To
					avoid disaster, I’ll give you an idea that can be very useful, it imitates the work of architects
					and designers. Draw where the furniture goes and anticipate general, ambient, and spot lighting
					needs. Don't forget the wall outlets.

				<p class="mt-3">
					You sometimes fall in love with a <a class=""
						href="/furniture/bedroom/bedroom-furniture">bedroom set</a>, <a class=""
						href="/furniture/living-room/living-room-furniture">living room set</a>, <a class=""
						href="/furniture/dining-room/dining-room-furniture">dining room set</a>, or any other piece of
					furniture and forget to measure your space. In this case, it’s possible to get some surprises when
					we place them in the predestined place and realize that the piece of furniture is too big or too
					small for the space. For this reason, it is essential to take note of all the measurements and make
					sure they are optimal and leave the necessary space for passageways.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					As much as you like a piece of furniture, before buying it ask yourself if it really fits your needs
					and the space it will occupy.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					Don't be scared, just make your plan and follow it. Don’t forget that as much as you like it, before
					buying it ask yourself if it really fits your needs and the space you have. Don't be afraid of dark
					colors in your home. It is true that they are famous for reducing spaces, but if you contrast them
					with light tones, they can even visually enlarge your space. Use dark tones in their proper measure
					to highlight the wall of the headboard in a bedroom with natural light or for upholstering a sofa in
					a living room decorated in neutral tones.

					By simplifying the decoration of your home, you may feel relieved and ready to take action. It is
					not about exposing everything, instead only what you really need. From time to time, you can change
					the photos or accent pieces. Choosing the wrong furniture, not placing it in the right place, or
					making a mistake with the colors and fabrics are other common decorating mistakes. Keep them in mind
					when decorating your home.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					As human beings we make mistakes, but most of them can be avoided when it comes to decoration. Will
					it feel rewarding? Yes, you will not have unpleasant surprises, you will have progressed interior
					design in your own home. Remember this, the home never starts from the roof, but if it's too late,
					it can almost always be rectified. The same goes for decoration.
					<br class="" /><br class="" />
					Enjoy the process! Have a good time and trust your instincts. You will see how once the fear has
					disappeared; the fun begins. Thank you very much for reading and I say goodbye until the next
					article.

					Wow! It's amazing how 2022 flew by. The year is almost over and that gives us the opportunity to
					have new resolutions, and one of them can surely be decorating our home. Improving every space in
					our home is essential because at the end of the day it benefits us, the decorator, and our families.
					<br/><br/>
					I must say that it is difficult to predict with certainty the trends in interior decoration for
					2023, since they depend on many factors, such as the change in consumer preferences, the influence
					of fashion and design, advances in technology, and construction materials. However, there are some
					trends that may be popular in the coming year.
					<br/><br/>
					I think it is important to keep in mind that our personal tastes should be reflected in the decor of
					our home. The colors, formats, and designs must be to our liking. In this way, we will achieve that
					feeling of comfort and that sense of belonging in our own spaces.
					<br/><br/>
					From invigorating natural settings, serene colors with touches of joy, and luxurious spaces that set
					the tone for opulence in our homes, 2023 is loaded with inspiration for total comfort. That is why
					today I want to share with you these home decor trends.

				<p class="mt-3">
					It is true that when it comes to decorating there are styles that are here to stay and 2023 brings
					us many more natural elements into all the rooms in our home.
					<br/><br/>
					Some natural elements such as plants, botanical prints, and allusive colors will be a pillar of this
					trend in interior design.
					<br/><br/>
					The idea is to capture the concept of well-being in our home. A good way to do it would be through
					textures such as cotton, velvet, wool and other materials like raw ceramic and stone.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">2. THE CURVES</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Arches and round shapes are making their way back into interior design trends. The <a
						href="/furniture/living-room/living-room-furniture">furniture</a> in the shape of
					a crescent, the circular rugs, the <a href="/furniture/living-room/living-room-furniture">sofas</a> with
					organic silhouettes, and tulip <a href="/furniture/living-room/living-room-furniture?type=chairs">chairs</a> will
					indisputably continue to be forerunners of this trend.
					<br/><br/>
					However, I have to highlight that 2023 takes this trend to the next level and we will see even more
					curved details in architectural elements such as windows and doors, as well as <a
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=mirror">mirrors</a>, wardrobes, and <a
						href="/furniture/bedroom/bedroom-furniture?type=nightstands">nightstands</a> among others.
					<br/><br/>
					Finally, this trend will see a revival of niches and circular shelves that have been used since the
					Renaissance to exalt works of <a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=art">art</a> and <a
						href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=sculpture">sculptures</a>. Using them in homes decor will be great since
					they can function as dividers, visual finishes, and even to create micro-environments within your
					home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					An excellent idea for this 2023 are the colors that can convey a sense of calm and touches of joy in
					the blink of an eye.
					<br/><br/>
					The color lavender is a great idea. This is a tone already used in interior design but in 2023 it
					brings a new version called digital lavender. It is a very soft pastel purple that invites calm and
					evokes joy at the same time in any interior.
					<br/><br/>
					The color lavender is already a highly appreciated color in interior design thanks to its relaxing
					properties, it evolves from the pastel pinks that had gained ground in millennial design.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4. GLAMOR IS BACK</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					This is one of the most innovative trends for 2023. It will be about luxury and glamor at home.
					Luxury will be present through finishes and textures rich in details that evoke elegance, moving
					further and further away from minimalist and simple styles.
					<br/><br/>
					This trend will bring a new concept to your home. Comfort and luxury will take the leading role of
					your day to day as if it were staying in an exclusive resort. Luxury finishes will appear in
					different unexpected areas of the home, as well as sophisticated fabrics, striking textures, and
					deep colors.
					<br/><br/>
					Of course, this trend wouldn't be complete without its dose of details. From warm metals such as
					gold or brass, to <a href="/search?page=1&limit=12&search=vases">vases</a> golden with organic and floral
					ornaments. Everything will be a work of art that will give us the guideline to maintain a
					comfortable but luxurious aesthetic in the home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					While emphasizing adding value to your home in different ways, we will find the concept of healthy
					living. It means that 2023 will bring us even more ways to adapt our home towards a healthy and
					natural life, helping us to maintain an emotional well-being in our home that will benefit us and
					our family.
					<br/><br/>
					It will trend to have decorated and well-thought-out spaces, solving from the organization to the
					finishes that help us reduce the tension and stress of day to day; but above all, new spaces will
					appear in our home. Little corners where we can develop our mind, such as a reading corner, a chaise
					lounge type sofa, and/or a small green balcony will be the protagonists of a more balanced and
					healthy life.
					<br/><br/>
					I have no doubts that there are many ways to work on interiors, but we must make the right choice of
					resources. No, it's not a matter of choosing them randomly. For this reason, my recommendation is
					that you analyze the current state of each room in your home, apply colors according to your
					personality, and choose the appropriate decorative elements so that the entire home looks more
					beautiful and elegant.
					<br/><br/>
					An added value to the decoration could be the combination of materials and shapes. In this sense, it
					is important that nothing is isolated or alone, it is preferable that there be a relationship
					between all the resources to achieve aesthetic harmony. For example, a wooden chest of drawers with
					vases on top, a wicker chair next to a minimalist-style table, and windows that fit chromatically
					with the rest of the decoration among other things.
					<br/><br/>
					Therefore, if you are bored with your home decor, why not start changing it? Go ahead and start
					giving your home more personality! I can assure you that you will not regret it. Thank you very much
					for reading and I say goodbye until the next article.

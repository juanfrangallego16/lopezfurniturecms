					With the passage of time, new trends in interior decoration emerge, which means that many of us make
					small or large changes in our home from time to time.<br/><br/>It is true that trends change and
					evolve, but it is also true that they do so at different rates. Some are popular and last over time,
					others only for a few seasons.<br/><br/>An example of this could be trends like Nordic,
					minimalist, classic style, among others since they have been around for years and yet continue to
					surprise and delight us over time.<br/><br/>We have started a new year and I want to share with
					you some trends in interior decoration for this 2022.

				<p class="mt-3">
					We know that elegant and traditional never goes out of style, which is why this type of decoration
					continues to be a trend among living room styles. To achieve this style in your home, it is best to
					choose spacious furniture and elegant elements. With colorful elements such as vases, chandeliers,
					and sculptures.<br/><br/>In this type of style, it is important to combine the colors correctly,
					mainly using light and neutral tones, such as beige and white. It's also a good idea to choose
					accessories with a metallic look, as well as items that are a bit ostentatious, such as crystal
					pendants, large curtains in neutral colors, mirrors, and portraits that showcase some of your
					family's most special moments.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">2.ABSTRACT DESIGN</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					It is one of the funniest trends. It is inspired by abstract expressionist art. In this trend we can
					see bold geometries, hand-drawn sketches, and even fun blocks of color.<br/><br/>The purpose of
					this style is to evoke emotions and create spaces with positive and cheerful environments. Bold
					patterns and vibrant colors provide a fun approach to living room decor.<br/><br/>Much like the
					expressionist art movement, this trend celebrates the imperfection and fluidity of hand-drawn
					shapes. Line drawings play a key focus within this style.

				<p class="mt-3">
					If you are a lover of the trends of calm, comfortable and relaxed spaces. There are several options
					that can work perfectly, it's just about making our homes a safe and welcoming space to rest and
					regenerate.<br/><br/>Create a quiet yet uplifting space to disconnect from the outside world. In
					this you can even apply the trend of being conscious of sustainability. If you like a simple,
					understated, and understated style, but still want a home that feels relaxed and comfortable rather
					than overly minimalist, you could combine it with a craftsmanship style, natural materials, and
					unrefined finishes. Textures and tactile qualities are replacing bold colors to add
					interest.<br/><br/>It is this type of decoration I would recommend adopting warm neutral tones,
					such as oatmeal and natural suede. Beige returns as the perfect base color to build on.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4.CONTEMPORARY</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					To create contemporary living room styles, it is important that you select rich colors combined with
					more subtle elements. For example, you could keep the walls a light color and choose furniture in
					terracotta tones or even patterns. The most important thing is to experiment with shapes and colors
					to create a fresh and modern space.<br/><br/>Among these types of styles, minimalist touches can
					also be used, with elements of straight lines and soft colors that provide decorative details to the
					space. It is also possible to create a combination of styles, adding modernity through the range of
					colors, elegance through the lamps, and simplicity with subtle pieces of art.

				<p class="mt-3">
					There is no doubt that this trend reinvents the sophisticated elegance of the thirties with a little
					opulence in the style of the seventies.<br/><br/>Furniture with curves and flowing shapes take
					center stage in this elegant style. Think of the elegant chairs of the 1920s with shell-shaped backs
					and smooth edges.<br/><br/>Dare to choose rich hues for key pieces, such as royal blue or ruby,
					mixed with warmer tones of ochre, pink and bronze. Apply metallic touches, think shimmering gold,
					copper, and bronze.<br/><br/>This trend is perfect for those who want to show off their quirky and
					glamorous side in the living room. Velvet is coming in strong for the coming seasons, especially
					when it comes to furniture.<br/><br/>Investing in a velvet sofa is a great way to pull off the
					look. However, if you're not ready to take that step, opt for a velvet cocktail chair or a glamorous
					light fixture.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">6.JAPANDI</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					There are many elements of Japanese design that have been present in the interior collections during
					the last few seasons. Several decor and furniture homes have presented us with collections full of
					rich silk textures, elegant bird motifs, stylized oriental prints, and structured furniture
					shapes.<br/><br/>A mix of elegant Japanese minimalism and rustic Scandinavian simplicity, Japandi
					is a hybrid trend that brings together the best of these two beloved styles. This trend is for you
					if your home is your sanctuary and you want a less-is-more approach with uncluttered spaces, clean
					lines, and a calm, subdued color palette.<br/><br/>Choosing quality over quantity will give small
					spaces a feeling of spaciousness. While more intricate patterns and bold dark pieces work just as
					well in larger rooms.<br/><br/>Soft lighting, like this bamboo floor lamp, helps add soft ambient
					light that will always keep homes calm and serene.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Another of the most fun and creative room styles is retro decoration. This is one of the styles that
					has generated the most trend and will continue to do so in the coming years. To achieve a retro
					room, the first thing you should do is acquire retro-style furniture, with contrasting colors to the
					rest of the space.<br/><br/>It is important that you complement the style with many colorful
					accessories that allude to a particular era, such as radios or old trunks. As well as shelves,
					clocks, and even fun details like telephones from the 60s.

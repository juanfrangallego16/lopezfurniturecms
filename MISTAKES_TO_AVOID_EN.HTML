				<p class="mt-3">
					This is one of the most common mistakes that many make, storing the elements in any free space, when
					the best would be where it is most practical. Whenever we talk about organization, it must be borne
					in mind that it is essential to store items by categories and similarities. This way it will be much
					easier to find things in the kitchen.<br/><br/>When we do not know how to take advantage of every
					corner of the kitchen, on many occasions this can generate a lot of disorder within
					it.<br/><br/>So, remember, first take everything out and take inventory of what you have. Once
					everything is categorized you can organize. Do not pile up and do not throw everything in the
					drwers. If you are organized, you will see how you will have space to spare.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Each product, each tool in the kitchen has its function and, therefore, it must also have a suitable
					place to store it. You should avoid having a mess in the drawers. Which sadly is so common in many
					kitchens.<br/><br/>We know that everything that goes to this type of drawers ends up in oblivion
					on many occasions. We encourage you to try to reorganize it and it is possible that you will get a
					surprise with everything you had forgotten.<br/><br/>Drawers can reveal a lot about how we
					organize the kitchen. Remember that these areas are not made to pile everything. If you want to
					achieve optimal organization, the best thing is to remove what is in all the drawers, review and
					divide by categories.

				<p class="mt-3">
					It is important to be clear about the functionality and practicality of the containers where we keep
					spices, sauces, and others. It can be tempting to buy a less expensive product, but in the end, it
					may be less functional and not actually meet our needs.<br/><br/>However, it is always best to
					invest in good quality containers that are useful, with safe lids, and environmentally friendly
					materials. Sometimes the cheapest ones can be made of a material whose life will be shorter and will
					protect our food less. Therefore, our recommendation is that it is better to buy glass containers
					instead of plastic ones.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Yes, everything is behind closed doors. If it is crazy in the fridge if we do not open it, it is not
					visible. But we are aware that organizing the refrigerator can offer a better performance of it and
					a better display of the products you have in it.<br/><br/>Do not forget that when it comes to
					keeping the refrigerator organized, visibility is the key, an excellent idea is to use transparent
					and stackable containers to store leftovers and some transparent and labeled containers to put
					products such as cheese or meat. Of course, as you access the fridge every day, it is necessary that
					this be a continuous practice, so that order is maintained.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">5.HAVING THE COUNTERS FULL OF THINGS</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Failure to keep kitchen counters clear is a mistake that will take its toll. You start by leaving
					only a couple of things on top, and you end up with hardly any space to cook. Our recommendation is
					that you leave the counters free of utensils. If you do, you will see how your organization
					improves.<br/><br/>Remember, the countertops, kitchen tables, and/or bars should not be cluttered
					with things. Yes, it can be complicated if you live in the kitchen all day, so a good way to
					maintain order is to clean up when you finish in it. Tidy up if necessary and discard what you are
					no longer going to use.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Quality is important both in the choice of containers for storing food and in organizing objects in
					the kitchen, from hangers to dividers. Choosing quality elements is relevant, even if we must make a
					greater financial investment.<br/><br/>Remember that in the end "Cheap is expensive.” Sometimes
					when appliances very cheap can be impractical and do not last long. That is why we recommend
					investing in quality and, over time, you will have to invest less in buying new models.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Of course, many of us love to have the Instant Pot, the coffee maker, even many could not live
					without their food processor. But the appliances can pile up on the kitchen counter and make it seem
					smaller than it really is.<br/><br/>Our recommendation in this case is that you store electrical
					appliances together in a closet instead, placing frequently used appliances front and center so they
					are easy to remove and put away again.<br/><br/>Did you like this article? If so, share it on your

					It is possible that one of the most difficult things when decorating children's rooms is combining
					functionality, necessity, and possibility. Especially when the spaces are not large or when they
					must be shared by our children. It is particularly important to let children play and that is why
					even the smallest rooms must have a small clear space for their fun.<br/>We must be aware that
					children need a space to relax, play, and learn, a world of their own where they feel comfortable.
					That space is not only a gesture of love towards them, but also an adventure that connects us with
					our own childhood.<br/>You could look at a child’s room from this point of view, children's
					bedrooms are those havens where children dream 24 hours: awake or asleep. Places of creation, play
					and pause, capable of enhancing skills and emotional resources or, on the contrary, limiting healthy
					development. Have you thought about it before?<br/>If our children must share the room, we will
					have to use our imagination to make the most of the space. Ideally, if the dimensions of the room
					are large, we would be to be able to differentiate to some extent the place that each one occupies
					with two separate beds, two tables, and two cabinets to avoid arguments and to ensure that, even if
					they share it, each child has a certain sense of individuality.<br/>Of course, if the room is
					small, we will have to prioritize practical utility and try to organize everything in the space we
					have and even so, not saturate the room to leave them a place to play comfortably. At this point is
					where solutions like the classic ones come into play like bunk beds, multifunctional, built-in, or
					convertible furniture.<br/>As for child safety, there are many precautions to consider. There are
					especially dangerous elements that we must take care of, such as lamps, plugs, and corners. It is
					necessary to avoid placing table or floor lamps since they can be dangerous due to the plugs and the
					danger of these must also be avoided by placing protectors. As for the furniture in the room, we
					must try to have rounded corners to prevent our children from hurting themselves.<br/>Decoration is
					an important element for each type of space. Your children's room is no exception. Having good
					decoration can stimulate and develop your children's creativity from an early age. That is why we
					give you some ideas to decorate a child's room.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The first thing we recommend you do when decorating a child's bedroom is to paint the walls. Keep in
					mind that the choice of color is very important because it defines the identity of the little
					one.<br/><br/>The walls are part of the bedroom setting and play an important role in stimulating
					the sensory and creativity of children at an early age. The idea is to paint the bedroom and make it
					look nice and comfortable.<br/><br/>One of the most used decorative pieces are murals with animals
					or landscapes. They can show a certain personality of your child and match the themes you want to
					achieve. Remember to combine it with neutral colors such as white so that the piece does not lose
					prominence. Even if your child is a little older, the murals do not lose their
					validity.<br/><br/>Light colors are special for your children's rooms since they represent a color
					that is a trend for both girl’s and boy’s rooms. If you have a girl, you can decorate her room with
					pastel colors such as pink, purple, or lilac. For boys, you can use a natural green, blue, or orange
					color. Never use black to decorate your children's bedroom, as it can dull the environment and have
					negative effects on their emotional stability.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Bunk beds are special for rooms with small spaces. In some children's rooms it is used with a double
					function, to sleep and as a play space. They go far beyond their usefulness, as they are part of the
					decorative space of the bedroom. It is one of the best solutions if you own a small house and have
					two or three children. Depending on the layout of the room, up to three beds can be placed
					accordingly. The most important thing is to give dynamism to the bedroom by combining cabins with
					versatile furniture such as shelves and desks. You can even be more creative and make a decorative
					fort or bridge.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The real reality is that every home should have a play area. If you do not have a specific place in
					your home for this, you can put it together in the child's room. Remember that this is one of the
					most important spaces for your children, since here they will spend most of their time while they
					grow up. The first and most important thing is that this place has a specific theme with which your
					child feels identified to develop freely. Do not forget to put storage drawers or toy chest, as it
					is also important that your children do not have a visually contaminated space. Add colored rugs for
					a fun touch.

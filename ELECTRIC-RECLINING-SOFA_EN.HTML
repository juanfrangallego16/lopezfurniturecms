					This type of sofa can contribute to improving your health and well-being, since they allow you to
					adopt an ergonomic position that favors blood circulation, reduces pressure on joints and muscles,

				<p class="mt-3">

					There is no doubt that they are the perfect option to enjoy greater comfort and well-being in our
					home. These sofas have a motorized system that allows the backrest and footrest to be adjusted to
					the desired position, with the push of a button or a lever. But perhaps the biggest advantage of
					electric reclining sofas is that they can be powered by <a class=""
						href="/electronics/electronic-cables/cables?brand=enouvation">rechargeable battery packs</a>, which means you won't have
					to deal with cables laid across the floor that can cause accidents or damage your sofas wiring.
					Electric reclining sofas are <a class="" href="/furniture/home-accents/home-decor/recliners">furniture</a>
					that can work with a mechanism that is powered by a rechargeable battery that is inside the sofa and
					that has a variable duration depending on the use and the model.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3. CHOOSE THE BEST ELECTRIC RECLINER FOR YOUR HOME</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					At this point it is important to be clear about what you are looking for, whether it is a reclining
					sofa and loveseat set or a reclining sectional. You should also consider the dimensions of the sofa
					when it is reclined, since it can take up more space than it seems.<br class="" /><br class="" />
					Choose a recliner that suits the style and decoration of your living room. Electric reclining sofas
					can have different shapes, colors, and materials. Select a color that matches the rest of the
					furniture and elements in your home. Consider that neutral colors such as black, gray, or beige are
					the most versatile and easy to combine and find. Bright colors like red, blue, or green can add a
					touch of personality and joy to your living room but can be harder to find. Light colors such as
					white or a cream color can bring light and spaciousness.<br class="" /><br class="" />
					My recommendation is that you choose a material that is resistant, durable, and easy to clean.
					Another important point is that it fits your budget and that it offers you good value for money.
					Electric recliners can range in price depending on size, design, material, and brand.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Before you buy it, you should consider a few key aspects, such as size, upholstery, features, and
					price. Also, donâ€™t forget that it is important to take care of your sofa with love and
					responsibility, following some simple tips for cleaning, lubrication, battery charging, and
					protection. This way you can extend the useful life of your sofa and avoid possible damage. As you
					have seen, a reclining electric sofa is not just another piece of furniture, but an investment in
					well-being and quality of life. The cleaning method will depend on the material of the sofa. If it
					is made of synthetic leather, you can use a damp cloth with water and neutral soap as the most
					affordable option. If it is made of cloth or microfiber, you can use a vacuum cleaner or a soft
					brush. You can also use specific products for each type of material that we have in-store available
					for purchase.<br class=""><br class="">
					It is important to lubricate the moving parts of the sofa every 12 months to prevent rust or wear.
					You can use a lubricating spray or mineral oil, carefully applying it to the hinges, screws, and
					springs.<br class=""><br class="">
					Charge the battery pack when it runs out or when you are not going to use it for a long period of
					time. The charging time and autonomy depend on the model and the use of the recliner. Protect your
					recliner from direct sunlight, excessive heat, or humidity. Remember that these factors can damage
					the color, material, or mechanism of the recliner. You can also use air fresheners or deodorants to
					freshen up the smell of the recliner.

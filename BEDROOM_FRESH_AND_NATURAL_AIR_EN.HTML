				<p class="mt-3">
					Definitely no change is as easy and fast as this one. The time has come to put away your winter
					bedding, the duvet cover, and other blankets. Replace them with quilts that favor more appropriate
					ventilation for spring temperatures.<br/><br/>This way you will get a better rest. It is not a
					secret that excess heat prevents you from sleeping properly. So my recommendation is that you select
					fabrics made mainly of cotton and linen, the most recommended options for both spring and summer.
					You will see how its lightness and softness will be extremely comfortable.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Take advantage of spring to give more life to your bedroom with prints that leave winter sobriety
					behind. A good option would be to opt for floral motifs, geometric figures, or ethnic prints and
					embroidery.<br/><br/>You only need to apply them to decorative cushions, sheets, or some plaid to
					make your bedroom look extra cheerful. It is much better if they can also be in the colors of the
					season: pink, turquoise, blue, green, and yellow.

				<p class="mt-3">
					As the weeks go by and the heat increases, keep the windows closed during the day to prevent your
					room from getting too hot.<br/><br/>Take advantage of the first hours of the day and the last
					hours of the afternoon to ventilate and generate air circulation that refreshes your bedroom, thus
					achieving a healthier environment.<br/><br/>The most appropriate time to ventilate and oxygenate
					your bedroom ranges between 10 minutes to an hour, depending on its size and the number of people
					who occupy it. If you can only ventilate for 10 minutes, at least open the windows or balconies.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Preferably use cool colors from the color wheel, such as blues and greens. This way you will be able
					to visually refresh the bedroom. Blue is the coldest of all, it is perfect for providing a sense of
					calm, brightness, and relaxation, making it very suitable for bedrooms.<br/><br/>Green is a calm,
					balanced, and very fresh color thanks to the combination of the properties of the two colors that
					compose it. In any case, you can mix both proposals with any other shade to generate a wider range
					of sensations.

				<p class="mt-3">
					One of the best options to bring a radical change to your bedroom is to change the color of the
					walls or put up a wallpaper with fresh and spring motifs.<br/><br/>If you prefer not to take
					excessive risks, choose neutral, versatile, and timeless tones for the walls or introduce splashes
					of color in accessories and textures, an option that is also perfect for the rest of the seasons.
					However, the use of wallpaper will help you reinforce the new perception of your bedroom without
					having to invest too much, avoiding annoying extra work.

					The vintage style, if applied correctly with distinction, manages to capture the attention of even
					the most futuristic. Its warm tones and shapes with a touch of romanticism are the characteristic of
					this style.<br/>Many will wonder where the term vintage comes from. We will gladly explain it to
					you. This term comes from the fusion of the French vingt (twenty) and age (years). Initially it was
					used to refer to the style inspired by the 1920s. However, today it is used to define, in general,
					all styles focused on decades like the 70s, 60s, and 50s.<br/>The vintage style evokes nostalgia
					and sensitivity towards classic forms. In this style, handmade pieces that were once considered art
					are important.<br/>You should also know that with the meeting of different elements, vintage offers
					a romantic environment in which colors such as white, ecru, gray and pastel tones merge.<br/>You
					could say that vintage interior design is for treasure hunters, lovers of one-of-a-kind pieces, and
					patient collectors. There are those who say that the only limitation in vintage interior design is
					your imagination. It is a style that is now present in homes around the world. It would not be wrong
					to say that it is a new look of the retro style.<br/>If you take a good look at it, vintage
					interior design is old and elegant. In this style, the use of antique or aged furniture and
					accessories is a must.<br/>Keep in mind that the harmony of space and light should be elegant, but
					not overloaded. It is good to maintain smooth and flowing lines, carefully selected furniture, and
					decorative accessories.<br/>Our recommendation is that if you want this style in your home, pay
					close attention to the small details that allow you to recreate this style when decorating your
					home.<br/>If you want to give your home a change, here are three tips that will give a new look to
					your home.

					Of all the chromatic range that can define the vintage style, pastel colors on the walls are
					favorites. They are beautiful, special, and delicate all at the same time. They have so much
					strength and are perfect so that every detail in this decoration stands out. If you want to give a
					vintage air to the living room, bedroom, or kitchen, opting for pastel colors on the walls is
					best.<br/><br/>Of course, you can also decorate the walls in vintage style with bright colors.
					However, most of the time it is better to opt for neutral tones and pastels, considering that they
					are much more romantic.<br/><br/>Blue, pink, or yellow combined with gray and powdery whites make
					a combination that is hard to resist. Without a doubt, this is a decoration idea that will quickly
					transport us to bygone times.

					They say that there are pieces of furniture that speak. Of course, not literally! But something
					certain is that vintage pieces have so many stories to tell us and things to contribute to the
					decoration that we cannot stop listening to them.<br/><br/>Vintage furniture makes spaces more
					welcoming thanks to their presence because they have a special and unique appeal with history, with
					soul, that have stood the test of time and fashions.<br/><br/>If you buy some of this furniture
					from an antique dealer it will include data on its origin, such as the year and place from which it
					was taken. This information will lead you to have an idea of the treasure that you have taken
					home.<br/><br/>They provide a look with certain nostalgic notes, which makes you fall in love. If
					you are a lover of this type of style, between feminine and delicate, you cannot miss a good
					wardrobe, a four-poster bed, and/or a chest of memories in your home.

					There are those who prefer to buy original vintage pieces because they have a high economic value
					and are sometimes more aesthetic.<br/><br/>However, you can use any object that is old, either
					taken from an antique store or from that box of grandmother's relics that is usually at
					home.<br/><br/>The most important thing is to properly distribute them in your home to provide the
					desired style. Some of the suggested items are old edition books with leather covers, chandeliers or
					copper objects in shades of brown and gold, picture frames and pictures, an antique bicycle
					decorated with flowers, dimly lit ceiling lamps, mirrors decorated with flowers, small lights or
					worn wooden frames, 1940s or 1950s coffee tables, display cabinets instead of bookshelves, Chester
					model sofas, wooden trunks, rugs and cushions, flower vases, and any other rustic
					decor.<br/><br/>We know that time does not pass for everyone the same. As with wine, the
					decoration also has its great reserve that with the lustrums add beauty and
					uniqueness.<br/><br/>Even though in the vintage style the collection of many antiques is proposed,
					it is not convenient to abuse them. Over saturating the spaces will prevent the home from having a
					comfortable and harmonious environment. In part, vintage invites minimalism.<br/><br/>Vintage
					decoration is a style that has gained a lot of ground in homes around the world. It is a simple way
					to add more class and style to the spaces in your home.<br/><br/>In addition, it is a striking
					proposal to give old furniture another chance.<br/><br/>Did you like this article? If so, share it

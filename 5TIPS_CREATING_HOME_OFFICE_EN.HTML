				<p class="section-header mt-3">1. DEFINE THE WORKSPACE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					An important point that you should keep in mind is that your workspace is away from televisions and
					away from people to avoid distractions and interruptions.<br/><br/>Any corner of your home can
					become a cozy place you can immerse yourself in your professional obligations.<br/><br/>A room
					divider is enough to create the space that often becomes a necessity. Playing with spaces and
					learning to take advantage of them allows the small spaces of a house or the narrow space under the
					stairs to be a comfortable workplace.<br/><br/>Workplaces at home are as important space as
					others. In them, we spend long periods of effort in which decoration, organization, and lighting can
					be key in our performance.<br/><br/>A space in which you can feel comfortable always brings
					benefits and the fact that it is the place of the house dedicated to work does not mean that it has
					to be boring.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Something very simple and obvious, but sometimes due to the distribution of the spaces or the
					orientation of the home is not always possible. It is important to ensure that the workplace is near
					a window that lets in natural light, or so less, have good artificial lighting placed in a good
					position to avoid reflections on the computer screen to not strain your eyes. Lighting experts
					advise that your home workspace has more than one point of light.<br/><br/>Ultimately, good
					lighting in the workspace largely determines our productivity and contributes to a pleasant and
					comfortable work environment.

				<p class="mt-3">
					To be calm and concentrated, it is important to be in an environment that is not color loud. The
					walls should be a color that motivates and inspires you when it comes to getting going and
					working.<br/><br/>It is also advisable to keep a chromatic harmony with the rest of the furniture
					and elements of your office. White never fails and helps the space look clean and uncluttered. The
					one that most favors concentration is blue and some details in red and orange stimulate
					creativity.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are smells that also influence your mental activity
					and your mood. So you can play with aromatherapy: citrus aromas for memory and good spirits, mint
					for energy, and rosemary and jasmine for positivity and fatigue.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4. ERGONOMICS IS IMPORTANT</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					At this point, you should know that the computer must occupy the center position on the desk and be
					placed in front of you. If the desk is large enough to support the forearms and wrists you can place
					it to one side, trying to handle it without turning the neck. You must place the screen as far away
					from you as possible, at a minimum distance of 40 cm/15.75 inches.<br/><br/>Of course, a good desk
					and a good chair are essential. If you can, choose a desk-based on how you use the computer. Take
					into account whether you are going to spend a lot of time in front of it, talk on the phone, or make
					a lot of notes.<br/><br/>When choosing the chair, take into account an ergonomic model adjustable
					in height, with an adjustable backrest that adapts to the back, and is wide enough to protect your
					lumbar area. A good wheelbase will also help you move easily and prevent injury and muscle
					reloading.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Did you know that placing a small plant on your desk can make you more productive? That's right, the
					simple presence of plants can bring you surprising benefits.<br/><br/>Living with fresh plants and
					flowers can help you feel healthier and more energetic to carry out your daily activities since it
					improves attention and concentration, causing you to become more productive. In addition, it makes
					your workspace much cooler and more beautiful.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the migration from
					traditional work to “remote work”, without the necessary preparation or tools and without complying
					with ergonomic recommendations, can affect the conditions in which we work and with it our health.
					So it is good to apply these points and enjoy our daily work in a comfortable way.<br/><br/>We

				<p class="mt-3">
					A very important point that you must take into account when decorating small spaces is not to
					overload the environment with unnecessary furniture. You must be clear about the functionality of
					the furniture and decorations.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Opting for comfortable armchairs instead of sofas, to watch television is something viable and by
					making the correct selection of these, you can give it personality
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If you dare to, use decorative vinyl to break the monotony of a wall.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Remember that you should avoid placing furniture in walking space so that it does not block the
					flow. Another important trick is to create ceiling space by directing lighting to the ceiling and
					walls.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Do not forget that it is of the utmost importance that you keep the space orderly and clean. In this
					way, your spaces create harmony and comfort.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Keep in mind that side tables and folding chairs are ideal for storing and saving space when not in
					use, so they are a good option to consider for a small home.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					A good idea is if instead of large furniture, use shelves and bookcases to store objects.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					And do not forget that mirrors help to widen the space, so add them to the decoration of your
					spaces.

				<p class="mt-3">
					In small kitchens, you should opt for white artificial lighting of good intensity.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Be careful with kitchen utensils accumulated insight as they create the feeling of disorder and
					reduced space. So it is good to emphasize the importance of order and cleanliness. It is better to
					have a piece of furniture or shelf to store them in or you can also use hangers for pans and other
					kitchen accessories.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					You have to avoid placing appliances in passageways. In addition to that, take into account that
					stainless steel appliances give a greater sense of spaciousness.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					And a point that would be good to take into account is to use fancier folding tables and chairs that
					allow to free up space.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Remember to decorate with furniture and objects in light tones, such as beech or pine wood, metal or
					glass to create the feeling of a spacious room. For this effect, you can elevate your furniture.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If you like curtains and want to add them to the decoration, we recommend using the same color as
					the walls.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Make the most of the natural light in the room and it would be helpful if the curtain fabric allows
					outside lighting.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Mirrors are great to gain space in the room. So go ahead and make the best selection of mirrors
					according to the style you have selected to decorate your spaces. You will love the result.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The decorative vinyl also works well for the room. They can give a point of originality and
					creativity to the room, without taking away living space.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Did you know that forgotten corners are ideal for placing accessories that allow you to store and
					organize the many items in a bathroom?
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If there is no space to locate a built-in cabinet for towels, bathrobes, hairdryer, and cosmetic
					products, you can opt for less bulky solutions; such as base cabinets or drawers with wheels under
					the sink. They are a perfect option for a small bathroom.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					I encourage you to place small glass, plastic, or wood shelves to have all those frequently used
					accessories at hand.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					One point that you should consider is suitable lighting. The lights that least occupy space are
					recessed spotlights in the ceiling. They can be combined with a halogen light pointing at a mirror.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The most important thing in creating the perfect spaces for ourselves and our family is to have fun
					and do it with love and with the best disposition.

					There are those who think that having plants in the room is not recommended because at night they
					remove oxygen, but this is nothing more than a myth. It is true that plants, like humans and
					animals, absorb oxygen when they breathe. Let’s clear up the air and make it known that they do so
					in much smaller portions than people or pets. Because of this myth we stopped sleeping with
					them.<br/>Keep in mind that plants produce oxygen during the day by photosynthesis, counteracting
					their nighttime respiration. So, if you were seriously wondering if it's bad to sleep with plants in
					the room, you now know the honest answer.<br/>But if you still have certain doubts and the myth
					worries you, we have written this article specifically for you.<br/>Let’s discover together which
					plants you can have in your room to enjoy a better rest.<br/>There are plants that not only have a
					beautiful appearance and help to achieve a much more natural and aesthetic decoration, but also have
					a pleasant aroma that is very relaxing, and this helps you have a good night.<br/>We must be clear
					that by themselves, plants will not cure insomnia or any other sleep disorder. However, they can add
					some well-being.<br/>When selecting plants to decorate your room, it is important that you consider
					the type of care that each of them requires according to its species so that in this way they remain
					in good condition.<br/>Due to the aromas or the purifying properties of their leaves, the following
					plants will help you create a wonderful environment in your room, and this help you sleep better.

				<p class="mt-3">
					An excellent option to create the feeling that your small garden is a little bigger is to use
					different materials on the ground to determine zones and functions. Dare to choose combinations
					between grass, wood, stone, tiles, among other materials that will add style to your garden and help
					you define the spaces within it.<br/><br/>In the case of grass, I must point out that it is valid
					to use natural and artificial grass. Both can be used to create interesting designs in your garden.
					In my case I must say that I prefer natural grass. I think and feel that it makes you feel more in
					tune with nature. This is a great idea to integrate the green of the plants in the ground.

				<p class="mt-3">
					With the ground modifications, you can also create some divisions with plants and furniture. We can
					create different spaces within the same garden. It's just a matter of knowing how to organize
					it.<br/><br/>In fact, you can make use of furniture in different materials to mark the differences
					from one area to another within the garden. An excellent idea for small spaces is to take advantage
					of height. By decorating the walls of your garden, you create the feeling that it is a higher space.
					There is no doubt that installing a vertical garden will help you integrate nature without taking up
					much space on the ground.

				<p class="mt-3">
					In small spaces, it is advisable to opt for lighter color tones and pieces that provide visual
					cleanliness. You can also opt for foldable-i furniture that allows you to quickly transform your
					space. You can look for furniture that can be easily moved to use in different areas of the
					garden.<br/><br/>To make the most of every square inch, custom furniture is the best option. It

				<p class="mt-3">
					For a small garden it is advisable to select plants that are not too large as these can create the
					feeling of smaller spaces. Choose and position the plants strategically in the space, combining
					different sizes to create a more interesting design.<br/><br/>A good idea to decorate with plants,
					especially in narrow gardens, is to place them on the edges of this space and leave the center free.
					Installing the same type of plant organized in a linear way gives your garden a more organized
					appearance.<br/><br/>You could also add a fountain. There are different types that can be an
					incredible piece in your outdoor space and will give your garden a very relaxed and Zen atmosphere.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Choosing the right dining table for you will obviously depend on several factors, such as how many
					people are at home, if it is a table that they are going to use regularly or only occasionally, if
					they will periodically have guests at home, as well as taking into though your tastes and your
					budget.<br/><br/>As these factors vary in each house and in each family, I am going to give you a
					series of tips so that, regardless of your situation, it will be easier for you to choose a dining
					table that is perfect for you.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The material of the dining table is very important, since you should seach for something that fits
					the style of your dining room to create an environment that is harmonious.<br/><br/>An excellent
					option could be a combination that goes with almost all styles, and that is to choose a wooden table
					with glass, which fits any style, from the most modern to the most traditional.<br/><br/>A curious
					fact is that a table with a glass top will visually be much lighter than a completely wooden table,
					if the wood is also more delicate, the glass will act as a protector.<br/><br/>One recommendation
					is that you seek guidance from experts on this subject so that they can help you find the right
					dining table for you and your family.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.TABLE SIZE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The size of the table, and how many people can sit at it is an important issue.<br/><br/>If you do
					not usually have guests at home on a regular basis, if they are few or if they use that table
					occasionally, it is not necessary that you opt for a very large table, it will take up a lot of
					space in your living room and in the background it will practically be an ornament.<br/><br/>If
					you do not use it too much, it is better to buy a smaller table that does not take up too much space
					and that is somewhat practical.<br/><br/>Extendable tables are a perfect option if you have guests
					from time to time and need to place additional sitting space.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4.CHOOSE THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The shape of your future dining table is another point to take into account, the vast majority of
					dining tables are rectangular, but you will also find them round or square.<br/><br/>Unless you
					have a very spacious dining room, I do not recommend buying a round table, in comparison they fit
					fewer people and take up more space.<br/><br/>If there are not many at the table normally, square
					tables are a good option, you can find extendable square ones, that way it will not occupy too much
					space while extensi√≥n is closed , but when you open it you will be able to seat a few more diners.

					The best dining table is the one that best suits your budget, the one that has a solid structure,
					the one that adapts to the available space and the one that has a style that you fall in love with,
					because it will be a piece of furniture that will be in your home for several years.<br/><br/>Be
					careful with new trends. My recommendation would be a sturdy, simple, and timeless table that
					integrates well with the rest of the dining room furniture, avoiding stridency. Also, I'm sure you
					won't want to regret it or get bored of it too soon, right?<br/><br/>In any case, there are many
					options on the market for every taste. If you like the idea, I invite you to take a look at our
					website, you will surely find the best option for your home. Once again I thank you for reading and
					I hope you can put these tips into practice and get the most out of it. I say goodbye until the next

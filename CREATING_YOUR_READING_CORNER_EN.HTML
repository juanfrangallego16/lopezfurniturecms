				<p class="mt-3">
					The main thing is to select an area of you home that is quiet. If you have a nice view, it would be
					great, or a place where you simply feel comfortable.<br/><br/>Remember that it does not have to be
					in the living room. In fact, the current trend allows us to see that you can take advantage of any
					area in your home that is away from the hustle and bustle of the family, considering that it is a
					place to relax and focus.<br/><br/>Reading corners are the most appropriate way to take advantage
					of an unused space in your home and turn it into your refuge to enjoy the pleasure of
					reading.<br/><br/>Depending on the size of the room or space where your reading corner will be
					located, it is a good idea to opt for good lamps and furniture so that the space invites you to
					spend more time there.

					A comfortable couch or armchair will be perfect. Keep in mind that it is essential to have a
					comfortable piece to be able to relax. If you want to prop your feet, a footrest is a plus in
					comfort.<br/><br/>It would also be an excellent idea to add a small library to the decoration. It
					does not have to be a huge library. It can be a shelf in any corner, a place that is more than
					enough to accumulate your favorite books.<br/><br/>You can add a table. The objective is to have a
					small support surface where you can place your cup of tea or coffee, your things, or the book you
					have in hand. It will turn this space into something much more practical.<br/><br/>A good idea
					might be to opt for a shelf with drawers that has enough space both to put your favorite books in
					and to store other necessities.

					An excellent idea would be to decorate the space with plain fabrics or with soft prints, warm tones
					that convey calm, neutrals, grays, or any other color that makes you feel good.<br/><br/>Do not
					forget the decorative details such as paintings, lamps, and a touch of nature with a plant in one of
					the corners. Plants often have relaxing properties, reduce anxiety levels, and clear the mind. It is
					about creating an environment that provides you with calm and well-being.<br/><br/>A spot where
					you are decorating with books and storing them can be the perfect spot to turn into your reading
					corner.<br/><br/>A final touch is to light some candles to liven up the place and if you add a
					relaxing melody, you will create the perfect environment to enjoy your reading.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Ideally, your reading space should have good natural lighting. But we cannot forget that at some
					point the day comes to an end and you will need good lighting to be able to enjoy these moments
					whenever you please.<br/><br/>Also, on a cloudy day you can cry out for an extra dose of natural
					light all you want but you will need to find a solution. So, you are going to need a functional
					light that allows you to be just as comfortable reading in rain, thunder, or lightning.<br/><br/>A
					recommendation would be the use of warm lights with intensity control. For example, a pendant lamp
					or wall lights with double lighting are perfect for creating calmness.<br/><br/>What did you think
					of these ideas for reading corners? Do you already have yours? If you do not have it yet, we hope
					that these ideas will help you create the ideal reading space.<br/><br/>Did you like this article?

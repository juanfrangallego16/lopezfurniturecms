					The kitchen is undoubtedly one of the most important points of coexistence in our home, especially
					in the last two years in which we have had to spend more time at home.<br/>If you have decided to
					decorate or give a different style to your kitchen and you do not know where to start or you are
					still not clear about the style you want, let me tell you that it is time to pause and think
					carefully. What do you need in your kitchen and what rite of life you and your family will carry in
					it? Be clear about the use that you will give to this space and everything that is in it. This way
					you can get the most out of your kitchen.<br/> If you open the trunk of memories (metaphorically
					speaking) you may find more than one special moment in your life that you spent in a kitchen or in
					some cases a tragic memory that has given you a bitter flavor of either your kitchen or a
					family/friends kitchen. Most of us have had special moments in the kitchen with our grandma or
					grandpa? Believe me that these were precisely the moments that marked my life. I am sure that my
					love for cooking comes from the wonderful moments that I spent watching and even helping my
					grandmother cook. For me, it was the perfect space in the beautiful kitchen where the wooden details
					played a leading role in combination with the granite countertops forming a pleasant space. But the
					most important thing was how I enjoyed that space in the company of my grandmother and some family
					members, unique moments that would make a marked in me. A forever long memory.<br/>Kitchen styles
					are a reflection of the tastes, preferences, and lifestyles of each owner. We could say that the
					kitchen is the heart of the home.<br/>The concept that the kitchen is just a place to cook no
					longer exists today. Kitchens have long been spaces where you can create memories and memorable
					moments with family and friends.<br/>It is also important to be clear if you are only looking for
					an aesthetic renovation or greater luminosity. It is also important to maintain hygiene,
					cleanliness, and order in this space so that it is a super pleasant environment.<br/>However, it
					should be noted that there are also small details that will make a difference by providing a more
					professional result. As, for example, fresh flowers, chairs with a special touch, traditional-style
					ceramics, glassware, porcelain details, or any other decor that will help you highlight the
					decoration in your kitchen.<br/>The kitchen says a lot about ourselves. That is why it is important
					to take its decor very seriously and itâ€™s even better if we give it the style that best defines us.
					This is the reason why today I want to share with you 4 different styles for decorating the kitchen
					and I hope that with this you will be encouraged to take the big step and give a total renovation to
					the space in which you cook the most delusional delicacies.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">1.CLASSIC</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					In a kitchen with a classic style we can see that light colors predominate, even if you pay
					attention you will notice that the spaces tend to be White. This of course, is good because as I
					have already mentioned in other articles, light colors create the sensation of wider and cleaner
					spaces. So if this is the style you want to give to your kitchen, you can paint the walls in pastel
					or white tones.<br/><br/>There is no denying that this style is one of the most popular out there
					so far. In addition to the light colors, its design scheme creates a beautiful space and also super
					pleasant.<br/><br/>I don't know if you think like me, but for me this style will last over time.
					Something that can be appreciated in kitchens decorated in a classic style is the care in each of
					the details and the use of decorative accessories that are ideal for this particular
					style.<br/><br/>Just imagine some details like the paneling on the island, the crown molding, some
					ornate furniture, and some carved or forged elements.<br/><br/>If the classic style is the one
					that defines you then get to work and start giving life to your kitchen. I dare to assure you that
					when you see the finished project you will jump with happiness.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">2.RUSTIC</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					In a kitchen with a rustic style, wood is the protagonist, and without it this style would not be
					possible. To achieve a kitchen with a rustic style, you shall make a good selection of tables,
					shelves, chairs, and wooden utensils that will bring beauty and harmony to your
					kitchen.<br/><br/>In this style, nature and wood will be your best allies. Generally, rustic
					kitchens tend to be eclectic. You can find variety in this style since it is characterized by having
					a multifaceted dimension. In kitchens with rustic style, in addition to finding abundant wood, you
					will also find stones, commonly used design components, perhaps some hand-woven tapestries, aged
					finishes, and some textured details are also widely used in this type of decoration.<br/><br/>With
					this style your kitchen will achieve a warm and cozy atmosphere. Sometimes you may have a nostalgic
					memory of how good you felt when your mother or grandmother prepared your favorite meals for
					you.<br/><br/>And of course the most important point is that it is a style that can be combined
					with others and you can be sure you will get a wonderful result.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.VINTAGE</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					In kitchens with a vintage decor style, a mix between old and new can be made resulting in a perfect
					duality. Something that stands out in this style is when using some old wood objects and new
					appliances.<br/><br/>In the vintage style you can use colors with vibrant hues to spice up your
					kitchen. Original and quality furniture will be the ones that will give prominence to your kitchen.
					A curious but relevant feature of the vintage style is the classic finishes in the furniture, in
					which you can find curved lines, other components such as ceramics, carved wood, soft colors, and
					textures.<br/><br/>Can you imagine yourself in a kitchen decorated in a vintage style? Perhaps
					preparing some of Grandma's best recipes. In addition, you not only can enjoy it in the company of
					family, it is also a good space to share with friends. I know that if you choose this style, your
					kitchen will be a good setting to host your loved ones.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4.MODERN</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					In a kitchen with a modern style, neutral colors will dominate. It is a style where lacquer is very
					important, as are straight and pure lines.<br/><br/>To be honest, the elegant style of a modern
					kitchen is based mainly on clean lines, on the use of neutral basic colors, and of course on the
					clean surfaces to create a serene atmosphere.<br/><br/>If you like this style, you should know
					that it is important to carefully plan the distribution of cabinets and storage so that you can
					achieve a neutral and well-kept look.<br/><br/>It should be noted that you do not need to avoid
					color. A soft green can be a perfect base to spice up your white space. Undeniably bright white has
					a timeless feel to it. Black is also a neutral classic that plays on a bit of drama, as well as
					adding that touch of sophistication and depth to your kitchen.<br/><br/>With this decorative style
					you can build the right space to inspire yourself and thus let your inner culinary artist flow.

					Sometimes the dining room becomes the heart of the home, especially when important dates such as
					Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays are approaching. It is the space in our home where we enjoy
					delicious meals and interesting conversations with friends and family.<br/>It is said that in a
					house there are two key points to improve social relations: the dining room and the living room. So,
					it is normal that it is in these two areas of the home where people invest more efforts when
					decorating them.<br/>Currently there are a wide variety of styles with which you could decorate the
					dining room in your home, and if you get creative you can mix some of them.<br/>Possibly you are
					wondering how to select the correct dining table and it is understandable since the table is the
					focal point of the dining room. If you want a specific style, look for tables that perfectly suit
					it, but do not forget to consider your tastes. At the end of it all, it is a space in your home that
					you will enjoy with your family and friends.<br/>When selecting the table for the dining room it is
					necessary that you consider the available space. This point is relevant so that you can create a
					comfortable and welcoming environment.<br/>Good lighting is also necessary for this space in the
					home. Pendant lamps are perfect for this area. One of the most important aspects is to maintain the
					symmetry between the size of the table and the lamp you choose, so that your environment does not
					look disproportionate.<br/>Also consider the accessories that will complement the decoration of
					your dining room, such as a work of art, a mirror, or shelves with decor. The colors and materials
					you use will help to unify, give it visual balance, and harmony.<br/>Today I want to share with you
					some ideas that can be of inspiration to decorate the dining room, whether it needs a complete
					makeover or just some basic design improvements, such as a new coat of paint or a new dining room
					set. The possibilities are infinite.

				<p class="mt-3">
					A modern dining room doesn't have to look stark and cold. You can use colors, beautiful furniture,
					and accessories to add character and interest. In this space you will enjoy quality family time,
					therefore, my recommendation is that it be clutter free and full of style.<br/><br/>The modern
					dining room is elegant, but simple at the same time. With character, but quite simple and
					minimalist. In this style, the simplicity of the straight lines in the furniture is sought. A plus
					in a modern dining room would be that you add something unique that you hardly find in another
					dining room. Think of an original idea and carry it out.

				<p class="mt-3">
					I am very sure that candles are another complement that never fails in any type of decoration. For
					this holiday you can put together beautiful arrangements accompanying the candles like pumpkins and
					pineapples. Always try to do it within the autumn hue and creating something cute and original. But
					I can assure, that not adding candles to your decor will show.<br/><br/>You can even decorate an
					arrangement with pumpkins, flowers in autumn tones or dried flowers and some candles. I can assure
					you that with a little creativity you will create some beautiful arrangements.

				<p class="mt-3">
					A classic dining room is elegant and formal. Furniture is solid wood with curvy details and hand
					carvings. In this style you will find golden tones that can be reflected in mirror frames, works of
					art, or decorative lamps.<br/><br/>A Persian or oriental rug will always be a good complement that
					will help add elegance to this space in your home. Ceiling and wall moldings are also common in
					decorations with a classic style.<br/><br/>Curtains for a classic dining room can include multiple
					layers. And the final touch would be a beautiful lamp that fits perfectly in this wonderful style.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">4.VINTAGE STYLE DINING ROOM</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					A good alternative to decorate the dining room is to add some vintage pieces and decor. These old
					details will always be a topic of conversation.<br/><br/>You could include antique tea pieces,
					metal pitchers, and small glass bottles that work well as vases.<br/><br/>This style is often
					partnered with one or more key pieces of 20th century design, vintage dining rooms combine styles,
					colors, and materials from other times to become a harmonious and very personal space. This style
					mixes elements from previous decades and the contemporary era to compose a unique dining
					room.<br/><br/>Pick whichever combination you like best, or just use a neutral scheme, like gray
					and white. Walls with patterned tapestries can be an excellent touch. Then choose your furniture,
					glass tables, or rustic woods. Add colorful fabrics, such as curtains, rugs, among others. And some
					accessories like chandeliers, lamps, and pieces of art.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The minimalist decor is simple, elegant, and uncluttered. Each thing has a specific place and
					function. I recommend selecting a neutral color palette, you can also add few decorative
					accessories. Make sure you have good lighting and that the furniture selected for the dining room is
					linear and at right angles, these are some of the characteristics to achieve a minimalist dining
					room.<br/><br/>The minimalist style has been imposed over the years. This type of decoration is
					characterized using neutral tones, by its smooth finishes and simple lines, by its spaciousness and
					by being a very useful, comfortable, and practical style.<br/><br/>The decoration of the
					minimalist dining room is very simple since hardly any accessories are needed. In addition, it is a
					perfect style for small dining rooms.<br/><br/>I hope that these good ideas to decorate your
					dining room are of great help and that you can enjoy wonderful meals in the company of your family
					and friends.

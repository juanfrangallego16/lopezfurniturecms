					There is no doubt that decorating youth rooms for girls is a complicated task, since to choose a
					style, it is necessary to consider age and personality. Therefore, you must choose themes and colors
					that perfectly suit your tastes, without losing style.<br/>The time comes when girls grow up and
					you must eliminate the old decoration with dolls, castles, toys, and other elements that no longer
					work well for them, or that no longer interest them so much.<br/>When it is time to remodel a youth
					room, it is necessary to consider the personality of the young person, I tell you, I have three
					daughters, three young girls with personalities and tastes so different that they have not made it
					easy for me when preparing their rooms.<br/>The important thing about the whole process is to
					create the space that the girls need, considering their tastes. The older one likes a romantic style
					in her room, but without going to extremes. The second is the opposite, she doesn't like pink tones
					or pastels, for her the less details and colors is much better, her style is very minimalist. The
					minor is more of a Tumblr style, it is a style that has no rules. It only revolves around details
					that combine and look good with each other; besides, she is a book lover so you can imagine that her
					focus is to have enough space to place books.<br/>As you will see, I have three great reasons to
					assure you that it is important to consider the personality and tastes of the girls to create the
					perfect room for them, that meets their needs and that provides them with that ideal space, in which
					they love.<br/>Today I give you these 5 tips for youth rooms for girls, I hope you enjoy them and
					that you can put them into practice to create a beautiful youth room for the princesses of the
					house.

				<p class="mt-3">
					The bed plays a very important role in any room, it is definitely the main element. It is important
					to make the right choice when it comes to renovating the style of the bedroom. Choosing the most
					suitable one is essential, not only so that they can have the best of breaks, but also to make good
					use of the space.<br/><br/>Trundle beds are one of the excellent options for youth bedrooms due to
					their versatility and durability. In addition, they allow you to take advantage of the space, have
					an extra mattress, as well as drawers for storage, and only occupy the space of a bed. When needed,
					the extra bed can be removed and thus convert the room into a double room. Then it is easily
					collected, and it is again ordered and occupying the minimum space.<br/><br/>If it is for a shared
					room, an excellent choice for beds is the use of bunk beds. In cases of small apartments, it can be
					of great help to have such a practical element, since it helps to make the most of the space.

				<p class="mt-3">
					White is the favorite when it comes to decorating modern youth bedrooms for girls. It gives it a
					clean and minimalist look that is much sought after. It is perfect to combine with any
					color.<br/><br/>If the young woman likes minimalist and clean decoration, with some Nordic or
					Scandinavian style, the best choice is white and wood. Another of the most sought-after color
					combinations is white and gray in modern youth bedrooms.<br/><br/>The combination of baby blue and
					light pink is perfect for feminine youth bedrooms in pastel tones, both on the walls, as well as on
					the furniture and textiles. If you want to create a more childish or girlish atmosphere, then the
					combination of pink and white or pink and taupe can be a very flirty option.<br/><br/>Light lilac
					is a beautiful color and very suitable for youthful and modern bedrooms. As for blue, it is also a
					beautiful color for youth rooms for girls, both light blue in pastel tones and turquoise in more
					vivid tones.<br/><br/>Purple or violet is one of the most preferred colors to decorate modern
					rooms.<br/><br/>One of the best ideas to get it right is to opt for a neutral background and
					decorate the bedroom with accessories and textiles in bright and striking colors. In this way,
					changing the accessories will give it a new look.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.TEXTILES</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Textiles are important when decorating youth bedrooms for girls. Adding a rug to the room will give
					it a warm feeling, visually soften the room and can also be a very interesting design element to
					play with. Everything will depend on the style you want to give the room.<br/><br/>In the case of
					curtains or blinds, choose designs and colors that are in tune with the rest of your furniture and
					textiles.<br/><br/>Another accessory that cannot be missing is cushions. I love cushions because
					they are the best way to play and change the style of your bedroom. It is always nice to have
					several on the bed so you can lie down, watch TV or read comfortably. If you have a seat or sofa,
					you can also add some.<br/><br/>The bedding is also very important for the new decoration, my
					recommendation is that you keep the bases as smooth or neutral as possible, that is, the sheets and
					another blanket. This will be your starting point, your canvas to later play with prints and designs
					on blankets or cushions. Dare to play with the bedroom textiles, combine them, change them, or renew
					them.

				<p class="mt-3">
					In a youth room it is very important to have a large and well-lit desk, which is also accompanied by
					some shelves on the wall to be able to organize books, or what is necessary to be able to fulfill
					everything related to studies.<br/><br/>The desk is necessary in youth rooms. It is where the
					girlâ€™s study and it can also be a space for creativity where they can develop their artistic skills,
					either on the table or on the computer. It is vital to buy a youth desk with a spacious design and
					space.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Lighting is a very important point to consider, both natural and artificial light are necessary in a
					youth room. A good idea is lights hanging on the wall to decorate youth bedrooms for girls and give
					them a special and warm feminine air. Light should be an essential part both to relax and to
					study.<br/><br/>Another element to consider are the lamps since they can become a striking point
					in the youth bedroom. Dare to look for original lamps, whether they are lamps with textures,
					geometric lamps, wicker lamps or any that have a unique design and establish style.<br/><br/>It is
					also an excellent idea to place an armchair that is consistent with the decoration style. There is a
					wide variety of armchairs, where their finishes, their manufacturing materials, their upholstery,
					and their measurements, are completely different and can adapt to any room, style, and
					decoration.<br/><br/>The shelves are also an essential part when we create the decoration for
					youthful bedrooms for girls, since they need a lot of space to store their books, their boxes and
					all their accessories, spaces where they can expose details that they like, such as vases, plants,
					little boxes, large letters, or whatever they prefer.<br/><br/>Of course, I can give you these
					ideas and many more so you can decorate a girl's youth room, but in the end, they will have their
					own ideas. The first step is to ask her what she would like, and with her you can make the best
					decision.<br/><br/>Do not forget that the room of a teenage girl will be her refuge, her place of
					rest, study, meeting with friends, leisure, laughter, and tears. For this reason, her bedroom should
					not have elements that are not to her liking, or that are imposed, since in this way it is possible
					that the young woman does not feel identified with her bedroom.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that
					this article will help you and that you can enjoy the process of decorating the room for young girls
					at home, it is also an excellent opportunity to promote communication and coexistence with them.
					Thanks for reading me! I say goodbye until the next article.

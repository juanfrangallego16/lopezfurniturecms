					November has arrived! It amazes me how the days go by so fast. The days go by, and we realize that
					Thanksgiving is just around the corner. It is a very special day, ideal to celebrate with the
					family, and it is also an excellent day to reflect.<br/>Thanksgiving is one of the most anticipated
					holidays. On this day families take time to decorate their home to create the perfect atmosphere for
					this celebration. A day to be grateful for all the good that the year has brought and for what is
					coming. We also give thanks for the negative events of the year that taught us a lesson.<br/>This
					year we have many reasons to give thanks. I know that many like me lost a loved one due to the
					pandemic, but it is also true that many of us have overcome and today we are in good health.
					Although, those who didn’t survive the fight are not with us we shall still give thanks because they
					were a part of our life. This year we are prepared to give thanks with our family and closest
					friends.<br/>We could say that Thanksgiving dinner is the most important of the year and I am sure
					that many families start preparing several weeks in advance. Perhaps you have already decided on the
					dinner menu, the drinks, but perhaps you need to prepare for the decorations.<br/>If you are the
					chef in your home this year, get in tune with this celebration. It is nearly impossible for you to
					fail if you add autumn into your decor. Due to it being an American celebration, we are in the
					middle of autumn and the appropriate colors are orange, gold, brown tones, among others.<br/>If you
					don’t know what to do with the decor for this day let me tell you that this article can be very
					useful for you. I will provide you with some ideas that you can apply in decorating your home for
					Thanksgiving.

				<p class="mt-3">
					There is no doubt that colors play a great role in defining the decoration and setting the home for
					Thanksgiving. My recommendation is that you opt for autumn colors such as browns, oranges, yellows,
					reds, and/or greens. You will see that by adding the appropriate colors for the season and
					celebration, the atmosphere of your home changes and begins to get into the spirit of
					thanksgiving.<br/><br/>These colors can be applied in the different accessories you use in your
					décor. For example, you can decorate with pumpkins of different sizes and arrangements with dried
					leaves since they are very typical of this celebration. These colors can be applied into your decor.
					You can also add them to curtains, cushions, and textiles that are a part of the different spaces in
					your home.

				<p class="mt-3">
					I am very sure that candles are another complement that never fails in any type of decoration. For
					this holiday you can put together beautiful arrangements accompanying the candles like pumpkins and
					pineapples. Always try to do it within the autumn hue and creating something cute and original. But
					I can assure, that not adding candles to your decor will show.<br/><br/>You can even decorate an
					arrangement with pumpkins, flowers in autumn tones or dried flowers and some candles. I can assure
					you that with a little creativity you will create some beautiful arrangements.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Yes, flowers are the decoration that you cannot miss for Thanksgiving. From dried flowers to natural
					flowers, they are a characteristic of autumn. You could even dare to mix some dry branches with
					natural flowers, like sunflowers.<br/><br/>I encourage you to add some nuts and some fruit such as
					apples to your table decor. In the kitchen and bathroom decor you can also place autumn details that
					will be ideal for your home to be perfectly set for this beautiful celebration.

					Therefore, having a beautiful dining room set and decorating it with beautiful centerpieces plays an
					important role in this holiday. So, look for inspiration if you need it and create a beautiful
					centerpiece by applying the advice that I am giving you in this article. As a reminder, do not miss

					budget does not allow you to decorate it completely, you can establish priorities and in this way,
					you will give life to each space of your home without this taking away the dream.
				</p>

					When preparing the budget, do not forget to include even the smallest detail that you will need to
					create the spaces that you want so many.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The budget must be adjusted to the needs and priorities of each space, in this way you will be aware
					of whether the decoration will have to be done in stages and thus your project will be much more
					realistic and achievable.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-3">
					Now is the time to have fun! In the entire process of decorating this is what we enjoy the most.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Remember to take into account the size of each space in your home. In this way, you select the best
					furniture for your space.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Choosing furniture can be difficult for those who have not defined the style they want to in the
					different spaces. If this is your case, we recommend you seek guidance from experts in or look at
					references online to help you define your desired style.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If you already know the style you want, it will be much easier for you to select the furniture that
					will make your space a home.

				<p class="section-header mt-3">3.Choose the color palette</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					To make the right selection of the color palette for your home, we recommend that you first select
					the furniture. Why you might ask.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If you choose the colors for the walls first, you might face a very common issue when it comes time
					to select your furniture. Let’s just say that the furniture you want is not available anytime soon.
					You will be forced to choose an entirely new set that fits the space in your home.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					It is for this reason that we recommend choosing the furniture first and from there you define which
					color palette goes with the style you have selected.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					One point to consider when selecting the colors is that they convey feelings &amp; emotions. This is
					good to consider for all the spaces in your home, but especially in the bedrooms to achieve a
					feeling of harmony and relaxation. This will ensure you rest well.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">

					might write a blog just for you.

				<p class="mt-3">
					Good lighting creates the feeling of larger and more pleasant spaces. This is one of the most
					important points when decorating your home.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					If the entry of natural light is relevant, so is choosing artificial lighting. Making a good
					selection of lamps &amp; pendant lights that harmonize with each space in your home is a key point.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					To make a good lighting selection, you must know the height of the ceiling in your home. This will
					help you if you want to add pendant lights. They come in many different sizes.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Adding light in a strategic place in the house can visually add meters of amplitude to space.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Besides, light influences our mood so it is important to decorate every room with good lighting,
					following different guidelines in each of the spaces.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					The same thing happens with lighting as with the color of our walls. Both aspects must be combined
					to favor the atmosphere that is created in our home. These details will decide if the home feels
					nice and cozy, just like you want it.

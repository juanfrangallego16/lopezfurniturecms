					well our originality, sweetness, and charm.<br/>The decoration with the characteristics of this
					season is a relevant factor when creating a cozy atmosphere at home. So, in December, do not skip

					there are also changes in the home, but they are changes that are pleasant, dynamic, and temporary,
					which will allow us to enjoy the comfort, joy, and magic of the holiday season.<br/>Before starting
					to decorate, ask yourself what feelings you want to convey with your decor. Think about the style
					and the colors you want to apply. Take the time to walk around your home and visualize the spaces
					that you would like to decorate, in this way you can have a clearer idea of which ones you would
					like to highlight.<br/>Today I want to take a short tour of some points that will help you decorate

				<p class="mt-3">
					Unquestionably, the Christmas tree is one of the star elements in any Christmas decoration. And
					nowadays everyone applies it in their own way. Some examples would be wall Christmas trees, white,
					green, natural, artificial, among others.<br/><br/>From my point of view, if you truly want a
					magical Christmas, your home needs a tree that meets expectations. Whether natural or artificial,
					the important thing is that it is the right size for the space you have. If space is limited, lean
					towards a small tree. If, on the contrary, do not skimp! You will see the light brough into the
					living room.<br/><br/>The good thing about Christmas trees is that you find them in different
					sizes, depending on the needs of each home.<br/><br/>My recommendation so that you try placing it
					in different spaces of the living room until you find the one that convinces you the most. Likewise,
					every year you should renew the decorations with the colors and motifs that go with the season.

				<p class="mt-3">
					If you are like me, you take the opportunity to fill your home with Christmas decorations, which
					completely change the atmosphere at home.<br/><br/>Go ahead and decorate not only the living room,
					take advantage of each space, the hall, the corridor, the dining room, the kitchen, if you have
					stairs at home, you can also decorate them. You will see how every detail adds up to make your
					Christmas magical.<br/><br/>Christmas wreaths are elements that can help decorate doors and walls.
					There are wreaths of different styles that will fit perfectly with the Christmas decorations that we
					have in our home.<br/><br/>If you have a fireplace in your living room, make it the second star of
					your Christmas decorations. In addition to some Christmas garlands, add some advent stars, some
					candles and some stockings in the most traditional style.

				<p class="mt-3">
					When December arrives one of the most used are the lights, either on the Christmas tree, in the
					garlands, or in any corner that you want to highlight these Christmas holidays.<br/><br/>You can
					find a wide variety of options with colored lights, with specific shapes, among others. The ideal is
					to choose the lights that best suit our decoration, and, above all… NOT OVER DO
					IT.<br/><br/>Placing lights on the tree, on the mantel, on the bookshelf, or decorating the wall
					will completely change the look of your decoration. You will see how the room is lit up with hope
					and joy.<br/><br/>Another option to illuminate your home is candles. They will help you create a
					warm atmosphere. Candles are the perfect complement to Christmas decorations.

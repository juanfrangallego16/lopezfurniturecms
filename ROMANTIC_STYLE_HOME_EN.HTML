					Would you like to have a romantic style in your home? It is the perfect style for creating a cozy,
					warm, comfortable, and peaceful climate in your home. It is Inspired by the past, but with current
					touches according to the contemporary patterns and accessories that characterize it.<br/>As you can
					see in the images I have selected, this style is dominated by delicate details, pastel tones, floral
					prints, velvet, and some touches of sophistication that will make your home a very pleasant
					place.<br/>As in other styles of interior decoration, it is the small details that make the
					difference. It is important to take care of each part of the process in this type of decoration. The
					romantic style is easily recognized, by its colors and other details typical of this style.<br/>It
					is perfect for giving your home the warm, cozy, and timeless atmosphere that you want so much. In
					romantic style decorations, wood is essential, if you use it in light tones or painted
					white.<br/>Other elements that go hand in hand with this style are flowers, scented candles, and
					bookcases. Thanks to its color palette, it is a style that is characterized by being sophisticated,
					very versatile and this makes it compatible with other styles in interior design such as rustic,
					French, Victorian, among others.<br/>Even though romantic style evolves over time, we cannot deny
					that it remains faithful to its principles; tenderness, delicacy, and has the strong Renaissance
					accent. It is a style that will allow you to customize it with ease.<br/>From wood furniture,
					flowers, earth tones and pastel, the romantic style contains endless possibilities that reside in
					the small details.<br/>Today I will give you the key to decorate your home with one of the most

					There is no doubt that in this style pastel colors are the protagonists. An excellent alternative
					could be a mauve, lavender, or pink color. You should not forget that pastel colors must be
					accompanied by a neutral color such as beige, brown, or white to give warmth and balance to the home
					decor.<br/><br/>In the romantic style, pastel colors are not only applied to the walls, but they
					are reflected in the accessories and furniture. In this style, white has a lot of presence, since it
					reflects delicacy and sweetness.<br/><br/>The most current trends in the romantic style have
					introduced small touches in aqua green, turquoise, and lavender colors to add depth to this subtle
					color mix.<br/><br/>An important fact is that white together with wood creates serene and bright
					environments full of charm. Pink and green in their pastel version are delicate and luminous,
					perfect to harmonize.<br/><br/>I would recommend painting the walls white or beige and combining
					them with a dark wooden floor. This is an ideal option for creating a feeling of
					spaciousness.<br/><br/>In this style, it is the small details and a perfect color combination that
					count.

					My recommendation is to lean towards furniture with rounded shapes, furniture with soft lines and
					much better if they are of an old design. You will see that, if your furniture complies with the
					points that I have indicated, this will perfectly harmonize the decoration of your
					home.<br/><br/>You can opt for furniture in white wood or with some light colors such as walnut,
					if you prefer to adapt the ones you already have to this style. A good option would be to paint them
					white.<br/><br/>Do not forget that all the furniture and accessories that you use to decorate with
					this style, must convey the sophistication characteristic of the romantic style. In the textiles you
					can use velvet, silk, satin, and cotton. The latter acts as a base for the other textiles. These can
					be used in the curtains, in the cushions, or in the furniture tapestry.<br/><br/>If you are
					feeling bold, use metallic accessories as decor and you will see how they add a touch of elegance to
					the spaces. Some silver, copper, or some wrought iron details are also valid.<br/><br/>It is only
					a matter of paying a little attention to the recommendations so that no piece that is part of the
					decoration breaks the sweet and calm harmony that the romantic style presents.<br/><br/>Do not
					forget the rugs, curtains, and cushions for the sofa, all of these are essential and should also
					have delicate floral prints in pastel tones.

					The floral theme is part of the romantic style. From fresh flowers to floral prints, they create an
					ideal atmosphere both in the living room and in the bedrooms.<br/><br/>The flowers, in pastel
					tones, whether natural or artificial, should have a space in each corner, each centerpiece, and each
					side table. You can complement the decoration with delicate porcelain figures and
					vases.<br/><br/>The details are important for creating different styles. From the long silk or
					velvet curtains to different elements to illuminate, such as chandeliers, table lamps, and candles,
					all these are useful elements to create a pleasant and hospitable space. Chandeliers can also make
					an appearance in this style.<br/><br/>The romantic style is more classic and can be used perfectly
					in more urban settings. Dining tables in the romantic style are always decorated as if you were
					going to receive someone. The use of linen tablecloths, porcelain tableware, and antique-looking
					glassware is a dominate factor in the decor. But of course, lots of candles and a nice bouquet of
					flowers as a centerpiece shall be a must.<br/><br/>So, get to work! Remember that the romantic
					style must adapt to your personality. Bring your essence and taste to the space to make it unique.
					With a little imagination you can make that great little corner of your home a dream.<br/><br/>If
